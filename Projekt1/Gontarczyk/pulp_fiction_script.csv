"INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING
</b>
               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace ""HIS GIRL FRIDAY"" fashion.";0.31570840999484062;24;16;11;47;63;0.115187;0.0715241;0.0458517;0.0428302;0.0403152

</b>
               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an ""Archie"" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,

               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.

                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in

"CAPT. KOONS
</b>                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign

               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of ""Ring Magazine"" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               ""MODESTY BLAISE"" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61

               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

"THE WOLF
</b>                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery – now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –

"JULES
</b>                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you."" I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Yolanda.

               She looks back.
