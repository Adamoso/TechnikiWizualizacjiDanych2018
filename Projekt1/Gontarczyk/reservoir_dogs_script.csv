                 About a year and a half ago, up in

                 John Dolenz, worked his way into a

                 job they found out he was a cop.
                 Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
                 birthday, a bunch of cops are
                 waiting in his apartment for a
                 surprise party.  The door opens,
                 everyone yells ""Surprise!"", and
                 standing in the doorway is Dolenz
                 and this other guy sticking a gun
                 in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
                 knows what's going on, this
                 stranger shoots Dolenz dead and

</b>                 No hurry.
                         (to the boys)
                 All right, let's get to know one
                 another.  With the exception of
                 Eddie and myself, who you already
                 know, you'll be using aliases.
                 Under no circumstances are you to
                 tell one another your real name or
                 anything else about yourself.
                 That includes where you're from,
                 your wife's name, where you
                 might've done time, about a bank
                 in St. Petersburg you might've
                 robbed.  You guys don't say shit
                 about who you are, where you been
                 or what you've done.  Only thing
                 you guys can talk about is what
                 you're going to do.  This way the
                 only ones who know who the members
                 of the team are are Eddie and
                 myself.  And that's the way I like
                 it.  Because in the unlikely event
                 of one of you getting apprehended
                 by the cops, not that I expect
                 that to happen - it most
                 definitely should not happen - it
                 hasn't happened, you don't have
                 anything to deal with.  You don't
                 know any names.  You know my name,
                 you know Eddie's name.  That I
                 don't care about.  You gotta prove
                 it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
                 this way you gotta trust me.  I
                 like that.  I set this up and
                 picked the men I wanted for it.
                 None of you came to me, I
                 approached all of you.  I know
                 you.  I know your work, I know
                 your reputation.  I know you as
                 men.  Except for this guy.
