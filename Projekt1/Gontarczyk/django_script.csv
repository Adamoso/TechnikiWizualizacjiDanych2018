</b>
          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small ""r"" burned into his
          cheek (""r"" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.";0.68956176191568375;24;47;16;11;48;0.355484;0.0933934;0.088422;0.0842695;0.0679929

</b>          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; ""Sold."" Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area

          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to""this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.

          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down

          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your

          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.

</b>          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way

          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five

          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
