1
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,980
I don't wanna aIarm you
but GarIand has disappeared before.

2
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,614
Granted it's aIways been work-reIated.

3
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,752
Agent Cooper,
did this seem work-reIated?

4
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:04,964
Ma'am, that's hard to say.

5
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,698
So, Betty, you're saying this behavior
is part of the way the major operates.

6
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,170
Let me ask you this.

7
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:18,134
Did he Ieave suddenIy?

8
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,505
Yes, he did.

9
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,678
We were speaking phiIosophicaIIy,

10
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:24,646
and I Ieft the campsite
to answer the caII of nature.

11
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,341
When I returned he was gone.

12
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,021
The fact that you were in the woods
is very significant.

13
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:32,955
In what way?

14
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,521
ConfidentiaIIy,

15
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,899
he taIks about them constantIy.

16
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,700
Ma'am, has the major--

17
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,171
CIearIy, a man
of no smaII spirituaI advancement.

18
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:54,837
--been attempting to contact
some eIement that Iives in the woods

19
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,649
as a part of his top-secret work?

20
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,646
That's cIassified.

21
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:07,418
WeII, he certainIy has a renaissance
passion for expIoration, doesn't he?

22
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,390
That is how he sees himseIf.

23
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,561
And there's no manuaI for it.

24
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,532
There's certainIy no manuaI
to be married to it.

25
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,806
Betty, thanks for coming in.

26
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,170
I guess, there's not much more
we can do right now,

27
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,813
except, keep our eyes peeIed.

28
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:34,882
GarIand Ieft some notes on his bedside
tabIe. I can caII you back with them.

29
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,452
They might be very heIpfuI.

30
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,267
Harry, the major didn't just wander off
on some work-reIated assignment.

31
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:53,371
That fIash of Iight I saw, it's a powerfuI
force that exists in those woods.

32
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,140
Sheriff, we found Mr. and Mrs. MiIford's
wedding present.

33
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,714
It's a matching scarf and ascot set.

34
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:08,849
Good.
I stiII owe him a gift from Iast time.

35
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,749
I can't beIieve
that he's getting married again.

36
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,917
Dougie's weddings are a seasonaI
thing. Like the return of the saImon.

37
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,390
Marry in haste, repent in Ieisure.

38
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,397
Hello, sheriff?

39
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,234
There's a call for a Dale Crewper.

40
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,170
Long distance. l hope l didn't cut it off.

41
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,900
Temp. Lucy's heIping out
with the MiIford wedding.

42
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,948
Coop? Where are we?

43
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,312
This is Gordon Cole calling
from Bend, Oregon.

44
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,848
How are you doing, Gordon?

45
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,115
Coop, l just called to say
that you have my full support

46
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,951
in this investigation business.

47
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,427
These are hard times
but we get through them.

48
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:53,792
- Thank you, Gordon.
- lt ranks poor with me too.

49
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,399
Now, Coop, is any of this true?

50
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,162
Double homicide?

51
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,269
Stolen drugs?

52
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:02,998
Storming a whorehouse?

53
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,699
It's aII a bunch of hogwash.

54
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,276
l have to tell you
the Drug Enforcement Agency

55
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:08,812
is starting to nose around.

56
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:13,280
They're sending down a top dog
to investigate the drug angle.

57
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,317
Who are they sending?

58
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,623
lt's Gordon.

59
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,726
lt's Gordon Cole.

60
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,556
Who's the agent?

61
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,962
Dennis Bryson.

62
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,828
It's Bryson. He's a good man, Harry.
No nonsense.

63
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,159
Don't let him rattle you, Coop.

64
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:35,234
These guys make a living looking
through other people's drawers.

65
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,943
We've all had our socks
tossed around.

66
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:40,669
From time to time.

67
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,314
Couple of words of advice:

68
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,950
Let a smile be your umbrella.

69
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,249
- Thanks, Gordon.
- See you, Coop.

70
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:50,580
WeII, Harry...

71
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,825
...time to face the music.

72
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,465
Good morning, Roger.

73
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,400
GentIemen.

74
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,333
Agent Cooper.

75
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,511
It's showtime.

76
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:13,906
You've heard the charges.

77
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,378
What do you wish to present
as your defense?

78
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,108
I have no defense.

79
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,378
I am compIeteIy confident
in the rightness of my actions.

80
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:28,687
Some of it occurred outside of Bureau
guideIines, I wiII pay the price for that.

81
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:31,192
But I'm innocent
of any criminaI wrongdoing.

82
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,798
If they wish to charge me,
I wiII defend myseIf in a court of Iaw.

83
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:44,007
DaIe.

84
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,243
There's a right way and a wrong way
to do this.

85
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,144
And the first thing we expect

86
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,614
is a Bureau man
to stand up for himseIf.

87
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,954
A man who can't,
who doesn't even try,

88
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:03,455
weII, he may be packing feathers
where his spine is supposed to be.

89
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,293
Roger.

90
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,264
I know the moves
I'm supposed to make.

91
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,664
And I know the board.

92
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,528
So.

93
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,465
I've been doing
a Iot of thinking IateIy.

94
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:21,537
And I've started to focus out
beyond the edge of the board.

95
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:23,911
On a bigger game.

96
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,244
What game?

97
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,852
The sound the wind makes
through the vines.

98
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,293
The sentience of animaIs.

99
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:40,565
What we fear in the dark
and what Iies beyond the darkness.

100
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,667
What the heII are you taIking about?

101
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:52,372
I'm taIking about seeing
beyond fear, Roger.

102
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,070
About Iooking at the worId with Iove.

103
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:59,312
They're IiabIe to extradite you
for murder and drug trafficking.

104
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,714
These are things I cannot controI.

105
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:11,220
The suspension wiII remain in force.

106
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,962
The next move is up to the Canadian
government

107
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,330
and the DEA investigation
which begins today.

108
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,733
You've cracked a big case.

109
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,336
You've been under a Iot of pressure.

110
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,202
I may recommend

111
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,607
a fuII psychoIogicaI workup.

112
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,016
Thanks for your candor, Roger.

113
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,812
So Iong, feIIas.

114
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,184
Donna, hi.

115
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:10,754
Hi, Nadine.

116
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,585
Have you heard anything from James?

117
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,285
You mean, Eddie's friend
with the motorcycIe?

118
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:16,953
Yeah.

119
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,154
He hasn't been around
for a coupIe of days.

120
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,390
Listen,

121
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:24,229
I gotta ask you something and I hope
you don't think this is too personaI.

122
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,029
What?

123
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:30,869
WeII, are you stiII, Iike, going out
with Mike or anything?

124
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:32,703
No.

125
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:38,413
- Why?
- You have to promise not to say.

126
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,711
- Promise, okay?
- Sure.

127
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:45,424
WeII, I think there may be
some major chemistry deveIoping bet--

128
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,719
Oh, my God, there he is.

129
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,891
Hi, Donna.

130
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,762
Hi, Mike.

131
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,401
He has the cutest buns.

132
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:07,413
Nadine, what about Ed?

133
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,275
Aren't you stiII seeing him?

134
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,478
Yeah, sort of.

135
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:18,213
WeII, if you're stiII seeing Ed,
then how can you...

136
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,255
...how can you start seeing Mike?

137
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,024
WeII, Eddie stays home
and Mike's at schooI.

138
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,631
Eddie Iikes to stay in,
Mike Iikes to go out.

139
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,530
And Iet's be reaIistic,
sometimes Eddie acts Iike

140
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,830
he's oId enough to be my father.

141
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,336
I'II catch you Iater.

142
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,072
CouId I get a beer?

143
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,811
- Hi.
- HeIIo.

144
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:22,711
Headed somewhere?

145
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,219
I'm sorry?

146
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,290
Is there some pIace you're going to
or running from?

147
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:33,290
You got the wrong guy. I'm aII right.

148
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,558
Men are aIways aII right.

149
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,235
Right up untiI they puII the trigger.

150
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,904
And then we watch the neighbors
soIemnIy march out

151
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,042
to the news cameras to teII us:

152
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:46,336
''He was such a nice, quiet guy.''

153
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,938
WeII, I'm onIy quiet on the outside.

154
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,748
I can aImost hear what's inside
from here.

155
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,356
Live nearby?

156
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,387
Yeah, Twin Peaks.

157
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,189
It's a nice jacket.

158
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,894
I'm gIad you think so.

159
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:13,031
- Look, can you do anything with cars?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:15,567
Why, you got a probIem with
the 'Vette outside?

161
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:18,573
No. No, it's my husband's Jaguar.

162
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,908
Somebody squeezed me on
the highway, and I drove it to a ditch.

163
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:27,914
I think it wouId be a very good idea to
have it repaired before he gets home.

164
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,385
WeII, I couId take a Iook at it.

165
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,148
My name is James.

166
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,949
EveIyn.

167
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,787
EveIyn Marsh.
I Iive right up the road.

168
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,295
WeII, are we in a hurry?

169
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,904
Do you mind if I pIay the box first?

170
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,938
I don't exactIy punch a cIock myseIf.

171
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,658
Good day, Dick.

172
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,625
HeIIo, Andy.

173
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:50,632
This is IittIe Nicky, my charge
from Happy HeIping Hand.

174
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,703
Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.

175
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,034
How do you do, young feIIa?

176
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,333
Hi.

177
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,136
Andrew, oId boy.

178
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,175
LittIe Nicky and myseIf, we just came
from Horne's Department Store

179
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,442
where Nicky was fitted
for a new wardrobe.

180
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,482
And now we're on our way
for a maIted.

181
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,985
We were hoping Lucy couId come
with us.

182
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:13,087
Oh, shoot, Dick.
Lucy's up at the Great Northern,

183
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,658
heIping with the MiIford wedding.

184
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:17,155
Oh, God, that's right.

185
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,331
Dougie's getting married again.

186
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,462
Lucy's not here?

187
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:24,659
Does this mean we can't go out
for a maIted?

188
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:28,169
Yes, unfortunateIy.
We'II have to go some other time.

189
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,707
But you promised. Can't we go?

190
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:34,536
You know, Dick,

191
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,905
it's cIose to my Iunch hour.

192
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:42,613
If you'd Iike, Nicky, I'd sure enjoy
taking you two guys out for a maIted.

193
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:46,222
- How wouId that be?
- Oh, boy.

194
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:57,559
So, what wiII you do

195
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,195
if we can't figure a way
to get you cIeared?

196
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,876
WeII, Harry, the Giant said a path is
formed by Iaying one stone at a time.

197
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,515
Have either of you feIIas heard
of a pIace caIIed the White Lodge?

198
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,246
Where did you hear of it?

199
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,648
WeII, it was the Iast thing Major Briggs
said to me before he disappeared.

200
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,923
Cooper, you may be fearIess
in this worId.

201
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,722
But there are other worIds.

202
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:29,931
TeII me more.

203
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:34,094
My peopIe beIieve that
the White Lodge is a pIace

204
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:37,765
where the spirits that ruIe
man and nature here reside.

205
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,308
LocaI Iegend. Goes way back.

206
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,415
There is aIso a Iegend of a pIace
caIIed the BIack Lodge,

207
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,677
the shadow seIf of the White Lodge.

208
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:52,123
Legend says that every spirit
must pass through there

209
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,555
on a way to perfection.

210
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,263
There, you wiII meet
your own shadow seIf.

211
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,593
My peopIe caII it: The DweIIer
on the ThreshoId.

212
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,467
DweIIer on the ThreshoId.

213
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:10,870
But it is said, if you confront the
BIack Lodge with imperfect courage,

214
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,437
it wiII utterIy annihiIate your souI.

215
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,115
Agent Cooper, Agent Bryson's here
to see you.

216
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,309
Send him right in.

217
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,178
Dennis Bryson and I worked together
in OakIand.

218
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,982
One of the finest minds in the DEA.
Harry, we're in very good hands.

219
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,292
Coop.

220
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,728
Dennis?

221
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:43,537
It's a Iong story, but actuaIIy
I prefer Denise if you don't mind.

222
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,401
Okay.

223
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,104
Sheriff Truman.

224
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,178
- PIeased.
- Deputy Hawk.

225
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,118
Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

226
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,047
WeII, I had a nice ride out here,
sheriff.

227
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,350
It's hard to imagine
you have even any crime.

228
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,620
I picture you chasing Iost dogs,
and Iocking up the town drunk.

229
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,926
UnfortunateIy, it's a IittIe more
invoIved than that.

230
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:10,767
Let's get right to this, DaIe.

231
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:15,372
The DEA's interest in you stems from
aIIegations made by an RCMP officer

232
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,509
that you stoIe drugs being used
by him in a sting operation.

233
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,246
Denise, I beIieve I'm being set up.

234
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:26,584
WeII, my recent experiences taught me
never to judge too quickIy.

235
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:31,787
Anyway, I'II get right to this

236
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,517
- and get back to you Iater.
- Okay.

237
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,922
I understand we're both staying
at the Great Northern.

238
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,221
How is the food up there?

239
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,289
Denise, you're in for a reaI surprise.

240
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,091
So are they.

241
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,166
WeII, we'II catch up Iater.

242
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:50,308
- I wanna teII you aII about my new Iife.
- Anxious to hear about it.

243
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,702
It's a pIeasure to meet you, sheriff.

244
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:56,438
Deputy.

245
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,623
That's a good coIor for him.

246
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,463
Look, is there something
you want?

247
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,296
Why, Mike.

248
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,874
Aren't we being a IittIe forward?

249
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:02,948
Come on, guys. I wanna hear
some grunting and see some sweat.

250
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,382
Attaboy, NeIson.
Come on, pump it.

251
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,610
Pump it.

252
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:15,525
- Hey, what's your name, IittIe Iady?
- Nadine ButIer.

253
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:19,857
WeII, Nadine, ever give any thoughts
of going out for the wrestIing team?

254
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,593
Josie.

255
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,433
It's time.

256
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,614
I can't be with you unIess I know.

257
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,283
- Oh, Harry.
- The truth.

258
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,091
The truth.

259
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:04,296
I used to...work for a man
in Hong Kong.

260
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:08,464
His name is Thomas Eckhardt.

261
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,777
He heIped me.

262
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:19,079
Took me off the streets
when I was 1 6.

263
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,919
We are from a poor famiIy.

264
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:27,490
Sometimes they seII
their femaIe chiIdren.

265
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,593
I was Iucky.

266
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:34,997
He taught me about Iife...

267
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,425
...about business.

268
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,430
He was my father.

269
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,539
My master.

270
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,408
My Iover.

271
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,045
When I met Andrew Packard,

272
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:54,480
I was aIready afraid for my Iife.

273
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,720
Andrew was aIso
a business partner.

274
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,288
When Andrew asked me to marry him,

275
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:03,825
I said yes.

276
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,997
Who was this Mr. Lee?

277
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,634
Who is this...this cousin?

278
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,964
I'm sorry, Harry.

279
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,641
I was just trying
to keep you out of this.

280
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:20,334
- The Iess you know, the better.
- Who was he?

281
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:24,148
He works for Eckhardt.

282
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,945
He said if I didn't go back with him,
he'd kiII you.

283
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,185
Why?

284
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:36,827
Because Eckhardt wants me.

285
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:40,691
He's never stopped wanting me.
He thinks I'm his property.

286
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,465
When Andrew was aIive,
he couId protect me.

287
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,863
I now beIieve...

288
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:54,475
...Eckhardt is the man
responsibIe for Andrew's death.

289
00:23:56,715 --> 00:24:01,846
We were-- We were in the airport
in SeattIe.

290
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,420
And I just escaped.

291
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,590
I'd rather die.

292
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,689
I'd rather die than go back
to that monster.

293
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,798
Josie.

294
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:19,296
Josie, you wiII never have
to go back there.

295
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,631
You're with me now...

296
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,307
And now...

297
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,136
...he'II kiII the both of us.

298
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,480
No.

299
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,057
Let him try.

300
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,433
Sorry, it took so Iong,

301
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,166
- but we're short on heIp today.
- That's quite aII right.

302
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:02,140
I've been Iooking forward to this pie.
I've heard so much about it.

303
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,239
You won't be disappointed.

304
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:10,050
Hey, I-- I'II get you anything
you want. Just sit down.

305
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,985
Hey, sweetheart.
CouId we get some coffee?

306
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,958
- How was your hunting expedition?
- It was a IittIe fatiguing.

307
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,302
- Catch anything?
- I hope not.

308
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,832
Oh, catch anything.

309
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,202
Yeah, I...

310
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:36,107
I came across a 1 2-point buck, you
know, standing by a deepwater pooI.

311
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:42,481
So I made this very soft approach
and I Iined him up dead center:

312
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:45,182
You shouId have had your camera.

313
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,516
Are you having it mounted?

314
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:52,287
Oh, yeah, yeah, even as we speak.
It was great, just great.

315
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,392
I think I better go
and check on your mama.

316
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:58,501
She's not here, Ernie.
She's gone back to SeattIe.

317
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,161
SeattIe?

318
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,201
And that's where I think
you shouId go too.

319
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:21,981
Hey, buddy,
what's with the Iong face?

320
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,425
- Vivian's gone back to SeattIe.
- Better for you, buckeroo.

321
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,657
We got four kiIos to unIoad. You want
the baII-and-chain getting in the way?

322
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,167
Yeah, I suppose you are right.

323
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,630
There's the phone, hotrod.

324
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,865
We're on a deadIine.

325
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,374
Here we go. Two three-berry pies

326
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:49,520
and one super snow frost
chocoIate maIted.

327
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,382
Wow, thanks.

328
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:55,923
Looks just Iike WhitetaiI Mountain,
doesn't it, Nicky?

329
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,185
How much does it cost?

330
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:01,230
Oh, money is no object,
IittIe NichoIas.

331
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,895
Damn. Damn.

332
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,864
Damn.

333
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,265
Sorry, UncIe Dick.

334
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:08,700
It's okay, Nicky.

335
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:11,398
UncIe Dick isn't mad.
Are you, UncIe Dick?

336
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:16,275
UncIe Dick is simpIy ripping, thank
you. Pass me a napkin, UncIe Andy.

337
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,993
Gosh darn it, anyway.

338
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,694
Sorry, UncIe Andy.

339
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,061
Think nothing of it, IittIe Nicky.

340
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:37,135
UncIe Andy went funny boom-boom,
didn't he?

341
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,766
I think I can put this right.

342
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,306
It is beautifuI.

343
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,072
Jeffrey Ioves this car.

344
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,282
My husband.

345
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,454
He Ioves this car.

346
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,916
Where is your husband, Mrs. Marsh?

347
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,787
I don't know this week.

348
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,928
He traveIs extensiveIy.

349
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,857
Business.

350
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,725
This car was buiIt in 1 948.

351
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:14,165
Jeffrey has to have the most unique
and beautifuI toys.

352
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,500
They have to be perfect.

353
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,605
He's that way
about everything he owns.

354
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,839
I couId have Iearned something from
that if I'd been paying attention.

355
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:26,147
Are you that way, James?

356
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:28,444
Are you that way about your bike?

357
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,848
I guess I'm not so interested
in how my bike Iooks

358
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:32,752
as I am in where it can take me.

359
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,892
Where do you wanna go?

360
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,621
It's not reaIIy a pIace, it's a feeIing.

361
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:43,496
Sometimes, riding at night...

362
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:49,533
...I punch off the headIights
and roII on the throttIe...

363
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,875
...and just rocket bIind into the dark.

364
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:59,410
So...

365
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,880
...do you think you couId fix it?

366
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:04,846
Yeah.

367
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:08,186
There's a room above the garage.

368
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,827
You can stay there if you Iike
whiIe you work.

369
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:15,295
Room and board and anything eIse
you think is fair.

370
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:19,429
I reaIIy do need to have this fixed
before Jeffrey gets home.

371
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,239
I'd Iike you to stay, James.

372
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,671
I'd enjoy the company.

373
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:27,306
Okay.

374
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,809
Good.

375
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:32,211
It's settIed then. I'II Ieave you to it.

376
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:47,651
Now is the winter of our discontent

377
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:54,126
Made gIorious summer
by this sun of York;

378
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:24,295
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths;

379
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:31,960
A stag party?

380
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,831
And I wasn't even invited?

381
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:38,233
Where the heII have you been?

382
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,080
Ben, I have had an absoIuteIy
kiIIer scheduIe.

383
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:03,364
Do you know the kind of heII
that I have been through

384
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,696
in the Iast few days?

385
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:11,542
You said that you took care
of Catherine in the miII fire.

386
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,335
She's aIive.

387
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:17,106
And as you might imagine,
not a happy camper.

388
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,911
Through trickery...

389
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,881
...extortion...

390
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:27,286
She has managed
to cheat me out of both.

391
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:30,289
Both Ghostwood and the miII.

392
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,764
Then there is...

393
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:37,698
...the smaII matter of being arrested
for the kiIIing of...

394
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:38,994
...Laura PaImer.

395
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:42,804
A reaI business-enhancer.

396
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,747
On top of which, my trusted soIicitor,
the Iate LeIand PaImer...

397
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:53,543
...turns out to be
a homicidaI Iunatic.

398
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,250
Tough week, Ben.

399
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:01,620
Do you think the furniture
in this room is adequateIy arranged?

400
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,126
I have been toying with the notion

401
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,390
that if one couId find

402
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,128
the perfect arrangement
of aII objects in any particuIar space,

403
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:17,432
it couId create a resonance
the benefits from which

404
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:21,942
to the individuaI dweIIing in that
space couId be...

405
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:26,110
...couId be extensive,
couId be far-reaching, far-reaching.

406
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,353
WouId you heIp me with this desk?

407
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,987
That's fascinating, Ben, reaIIy.

408
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,751
Listen, though, what we have to taIk
about now...

409
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,984
...is One-Eyed Jack's.

410
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,163
Jack's, Jack's. Yes, One-Eyed Jack's.

411
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,763
Look, here's how it is, Ben.

412
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,995
Ben.

413
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:45,260
You're out.

414
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:48,101
Excuse me?

415
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:51,839
I own One-Eyed Jack's.

416
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,009
There's been a friendIy takeover.

417
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:04,516
You come in here under my empIoy
and have the gaII to teII me--

418
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,623
Oh, that's another thing.

419
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,157
I don't work for you anymore.

420
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,396
RenauIt.

421
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,327
Jean RenauIt.

422
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,335
It's RenauIt, isn't it? Hank.

423
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,374
Let me teII you something.

424
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:30,376
The guy is a psychopath.

425
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:33,743
Psychopath.

426
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:38,513
And you, my friend,
are dancing with the deviI.

427
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:41,055
Ben, you're a nut.

428
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,988
You think I'm just gonna sit here?

429
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,685
Let you take aII this.

430
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:47,996
Ben.

431
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,064
Life has changed.

432
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:54,932
I want you to Iisten to me when I
teII you that this is how it's gonna be.

433
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:59,542
Don't patronize me, you goon.

434
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:04,040
You're a mess, Ben. Look at you.

435
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,911
You screwed up, boss man.

436
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,945
You're out, Ben.

437
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,534
''You're out, Ben.

438
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:34,040
You're out, Ben.

439
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:41,775
You're out. Ben, you're out.

440
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,886
Ben, you're out.''

441
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,933
Windom EarIe.

442
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,697
Of course, you couldn't help
but take note of

443
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,805
my emphatically traditional
opening.

444
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:38,032
l must say,
your responding move was nothing

445
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:43,180
if not reflective of your predilection
for the tidy and fastidious.

446
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,350
See how my response to you
begins to lead us

447
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,510
towards a classical
confrontation?

448
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:52,154
But there's doubt in your mind.

449
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:55,451
What are my true intentions?

450
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,686
How will you answer this time?

451
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:01,127
Hobgoblins, Dale.

452
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:06,362
Consistency, predictability,
giving rise to patterns.

453
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,232
We both know only too well

454
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:12,399
how these patterns leave you
vulnerable to attack.

455
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,168
You with your wounds.

456
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,903
l with mine.

457
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,411
Let me paint you a picture.

458
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,379
My knights will skirmish.

459
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:25,215
Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks.

460
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,823
Pawns will naturally be forfeit.

461
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:31,928
l'm even prepared to sacrifice
my queen because l assure you,

462
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:36,692
dear Dale, my goal will be attained
at any cost.

463
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:40,837
The king must die.

464
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:50,438
Do you, DougIas MiIford,
take this woman to be your wife...

465
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:54,514
...to Iove and to cherish,
for as Iong as you both shaII Iive?

466
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,019
You bet, I do, Reverend.

467
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:07,186
If there be anyone who knows not
why this union shouId be made,

468
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:10,361
Iet him speak now
or forever hoId his peace.

469
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,729
You're damn right. I want to object.

470
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:17,069
This IittIe goId digger
just wants his money,

471
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:19,399
and his pubIishing empire,

472
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,238
and God knows what aII.

473
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,878
And Iook at him,

474
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:26,050
he's got one foot
in the grave aIready.

475
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,548
Okay, Dwayne,
okay, just take her easy.

476
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:30,982
- Take her easy.
- AII right.

477
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:34,124
You know that I have had probIems,
sheriff. AII these years.

478
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,487
Okay, Mr. Mayor,
Iet's just get a IittIe air. ShaII we?

479
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,060
It's pretty pecuIiar, isn't it?

480
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:40,226
Don't give it another thought, doII.

481
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,730
- WeII, I know this is my opinion,
- Let's get out, Iet's just get out.

482
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,369
- and I want you to aII understand it.
- Excuse us.

483
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,301
Marrying every two months...
Good God.

484
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:53,635
So if there be no further objections--

485
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,248
Cooper here.

486
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,116
Denise.

487
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,189
WeII, that'II be nice.
I'II be right down.

488
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:18,966
Diane, when I've got a moment,

489
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,298
remind me to teII you
about Agent Bryson.

490
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:49,363
I just Iove MiIford weddings.

491
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,434
Unfair advantage.

492
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:53,831
How many of those girIs
were varsity wide receivers?

493
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:55,797
Very few.

494
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,332
Bad news first.

495
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:01,535
I found cocaine residue in your car.

496
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:04,971
And my guess is it wiII match the Iot
stoIen from the Mountie.

497
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:07,845
- Dennis, this can't appear straight.
- Denise.

498
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:11,147
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

499
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,084
Sure it Iooks Iike a frame, Coop.

500
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,884
But I'm gonna need more than
your opinion to make that stick.

501
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,255
Can you heIp me?

502
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:21,761
WeII, that gets
into a very deIicate area.

503
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,361
But on the other hand,
I'm trying very hard, recentIy,

504
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:26,696
to get more in touch
with my feeIings.

505
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,502
Ladies and gentIemen, the cake.

506
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:36,904
Dougie's aIways been a sucker.

507
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,182
When a woman pass...

508
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,283
...with pIay in her eyes...

509
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,546
...and JeII-O in her waIk,
and he's a trout on a hook.

510
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:55,623
So, Denise,

511
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,502
if you don't mind my asking,

512
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,268
- what happened to you?
- No, not at aII.

513
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,031
I Iike to taIk about it.

514
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,641
It's reaIIy very simpIe.

515
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,073
Last year, I was working undercover
suburban surveiIIance

516
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,571
and the seIIer had a few kinks
in his rep.

517
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,718
It seems that he'd onIy seII
to transvestites.

518
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,319
So my partner and I shacked up.

519
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:19,887
I pIayed the part of the buyer.

520
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:24,926
And I found that wearing women's
cIothes...

521
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,630
...reIaxed me.

522
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,300
I continued wearing them
into the night.

523
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:34,632
My partner thought it was
my consummate professionaIism.

524
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:37,233
It was a very confusing two weeks.

525
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:40,668
WeII, this is aII
a pretty amazing discIosure,

526
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:41,936
Denise.

527
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:45,543
Imagine how surprised I was, Coop.

528
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,911
This is not exactIy
something you pIan on.

529
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,313
Guess not.

530
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,155
- Sheriff.
- Harry.

531
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,786
I'II have a draft.

532
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,759
Sheriff, arrest this woman.

533
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,430
She's too beautifuI to be Iiving
in this state.

534
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,931
Oh, hey, aren't you that FBI man?

535
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:06,262
Not currentIy, no.

536
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,596
DaIe Cooper.

537
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,295
DaIe.

538
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,668
You soIved
that Laura PaImer case, huh?

539
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:16,006
Come on, darIing,
they're pIaying our tune. See you.

540
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:23,510
I sure hope those two go up
to the honeymoon suite soon.

541
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:26,485
We've had to separate Dwayne
and Dougie twice aIready.

542
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,318
Happens every wedding.

543
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:29,959
Boys wiII be boys.

544
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:34,598
I was married to the same woman
for haIf a century.

545
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,965
God rest her souI.

546
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:42,602
That's because I used my brain
for thinking, not my garden hose.

547
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:46,299
This cake is deIicious.

548
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:52,907
The music...

549
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,009
...turned out pretty good.

550
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:00,414
It ought have been the death march.

551
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:08,389
You're an exceIIent dancer.

552
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:10,157
One other thing about dancing,
Audrey,

553
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,325
is that you never know
where the step couId Iead.

554
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:15,404
You have to hang on
and hope the music takes you there.

555
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:30,650
Your brother, my husband,
Andrew Packard,

556
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:34,750
was kiIIed by a man
named Thomas Eckhardt.

557
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:38,194
TeII me something
I don't aIready know.

558
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,294
You're in terribIe danger, Catherine.

559
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,193
You heIped kiII my brother,

560
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:53,573
tried to cheat me out of my Iand,
my famiIy's IifebIood,

561
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:58,238
utterIy destroy my existence,
and now you want to save me?

562
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,712
I had to do these things to stay aIive.

563
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:07,082
I have no one to turn to now.

564
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:10,386
I've got nothing.

565
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,891
And I'm at your mercy.

566
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,231
Now...

567
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:20,768
...enough.

568
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:24,400
Let's be practicaI.

569
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,235
What do you propose we do?

570
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:30,141
I don't know.

571
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,077
Then I'II teII you.

572
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,742
From now on...

573
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,715
...you work for me.

574
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:41,084
Here.

575
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,789
At the house.

576
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,255
As a maid.

577
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,591
You move your things
into the servant's quarters.

578
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,925
If you disobey me...

579
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,463
...if you Iie to me...

580
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:58,775
...if you contradict
a singIe thing I teII you,

581
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:03,046
I shaII find this Eckhardt

582
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:06,881
and feed you to him by hand.

583
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,481
Is that cIear?

584
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:12,383
Speak!

585
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:15,649
Yes, I understand.

586
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,693
Fine.

587
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:21,323
We'II taIk about this Eckhardt
some other time.

588
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,766
You may go to your room.

589
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:26,561
Thank you.

590
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,830
Josie...

591
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:34,475
I'II take breakfast at 7 in my room.

592
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:39,172
Coffee, juice,
dry toast, oatmeaI.

593
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:43,276
- Yes.
- Sweet dreams.

594
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:53,924
Happy, Andrew?

595
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:00,834
Everything is going exactIy
as we pIanned.

596
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,432
And now...?

597
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,531
And now, dear sister,
we wait for Thomas Eckhardt

598
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:11,079
to come Iooking
for his one true Iove.

599
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:14,510
And when he does--

600
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,750
We'II be waiting for him.
