1
00:00:01,047 --> 00:00:02,605
Previously on "Twin Peaks"...

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:06,518
She's dead.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,038
Wrapped in plastic.

4
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,524
Laura Palmer.

5
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:18,246
Diane. 11:30 am February 24th.
Entering the town of Twin Peaks.

6
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:23,357
I'll be meeting Sheriff Harry S Truman.
Shouldn't be too hard to remember that.

7
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,483
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

8
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:27,319
- FBI.
- Right.

9
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:31,446
There are irrefutable similarities that,
for obvious reasons, I cannot discuss,

10
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,757
that suggest
Laura Palmer was the second

11
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:37,402
and Ronnette Pulaski would've been
the third victim of the same killer.

12
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,683
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

13
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:43,284
- No.
- If you didn't, then who did?

14
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:48,601
Dr Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.
Laura was a patient of mine.

15
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,042
Here's something
we haven't seen before.

16
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,397
A mound of dirt 1.5 feet in diameter.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:57,924
On top is a gold necklace with a gold
heart... Correction, half a gold heart.

18
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,756
Sheriff, we've got to find out
who's got the other half.

19
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,163
- Give me the other half.
- No, we'll bury it.

20
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:06,925
Donna, who are you protecting?

21
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:10,477
There's a chance that the person
who committed these crimes

22
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:12,444
is from this town.

23
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,279
Possibly even someone you know.

24
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:30,319
Diane. 6:18 am Room 315,

25
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,126
Great Northern Hotel
up here in Twin Peaks.

26
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:36,279
Slept pretty well.
Non-smoking room, no tobacco smell.

27
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:39,086
That's a nice consideration
for the business traveller.

28
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:43,126
A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air.

29
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:47,001
As Sheriff Truman indicated, everything
this hotel promised, they delivered.

30
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,079
Clean, reasonably-priced
accommodations.

31
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:54,240
Telephone works, bathroom in tip-top
shape: no drips, plenty of hot water

32
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:58,764
and good steady pressure that could
be a side-benefit of the waterfall outside.

33
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:03,284
Mattress firm but not too firm. No lumps,
like that time I told you about in El Paso.

34
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,443
What a nightmare that was!

35
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,758
But I've told you that story
once or twice, haven't l, Diane?

36
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:13,324
Haven't tried the TV yet. Looks like
cable, probably no reception problems.

37
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:18,316
But the true test of any hotel
is that morning cup of coffee,

38
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,836
which I'll get back to you about.

39
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:33,601
Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning,

40
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,406
there are two things
that continue to trouble me,

41
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,321
not only as an agent of the Bureau,
but as a human being.

42
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,480
What really went on between
Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?

43
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,162
And who really pulled
the trigger on JFK?

44
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:54,316
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

45
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:10,196
You know, this is, excuse me,
a damn fine cup of coffee.

46
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,798
I've had I can't say how many
cups of coffee in my life.

47
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,077
This is one of the best.

48
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:21,446
I'd like two eggs over hard. It's hard on
the arteries, but old habits die hard.

49
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:25,719
About as hard as I want those eggs.
Bacon, super crispy.

50
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:30,039
Almost burned. Cremated.
That's great.

51
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,319
And I'll have the grapefruit juice,
just as long as those grapefruits...

52
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:37,875
are freshly squeezed.

53
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,126
Audrey Horne.

54
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:49,156
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

55
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,845
Can I sit here?

56
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:58,124
Unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne,

57
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:02,206
the owner of this establishment, so I
imagine you can sit anywhere you like.

58
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:06,440
- I'd also add, it would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

59
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:12,245
You're here investigating
the murder of Laura Palmer.

60
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,125
Were you friends?

61
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:21,917
Not exactly. Laura tutored my older
brother Johnny three times a week.

62
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:25,519
Johnny's 27
and he's in the third grade.

63
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:29,526
He's got emotional problems.
It runs in the family.

64
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:32,036
Do you like my ring?

65
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,277
Very nice.

66
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:43,315
You know, sometimes
I get so flushed, it's interesting.

67
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:48,120
Do your palms ever itch?

68
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,040
Morning, Deputy.
Hey, Lucy.

69
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:07,126
Agent Cooper,
I got a jelly for you specially.

70
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:10,199
The Sheriff's in the conference room.
It's the door across from the...

71
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,801
I'll look for him in the conference room.

72
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:18,124
Hey, three for three.

73
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:23,123
Let's get James Hurley from cell four
and talk to him. He loved Laura Palmer.

74
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:26,882
I bet she told him whatever dirt
she knew about Mike and Bobby.

75
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,322
Then let's chat
with those two perpetrators.

76
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,047
Let's run a top-to-bottom
on Bobby's vehicle.

77
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,324
Also check Laura Palmer's
autopsy and see what that brings.

78
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:39,440
We'll talk to Mr and Mrs Palmer, but let's
give them time to deal with their grief.

79
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,559
We've got our day mapped out.
Let's meet in three minutes.

80
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,598
I really must urinate.

81
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:49,326
By the way, the coffee
at the Great Northern, incredible.

82
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,920
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura.

83
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:04,160
I've known her all her life.
She was my daughter's best friend.

84
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:06,437
I couldn't face doing
the post-mortem,

85
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:10,600
so I called
Joe Fielding in from Fairvale.

86
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:15,761
He did the work, I assisted.
This is what he found.

87
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:19,602
Time of death estimated to be between
midnight and 4:00 am.

88
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:23,481
What killed her is loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds.

89
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:26,917
No single one serious
enough to have caused death.

90
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:30,676
Bite marks on her shoulders,
also on her tongue,

91
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,560
probably self-inflicted.

92
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,446
Lesions on wrists, ankles, upper arms,
where she was bound.

93
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:43,715
We're waiting on the tox ological
tests for drug use.

94
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,567
Within the last...

95
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:52,283
12 hours, she'd had sexual relations
with at least three men.

96
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,357
You've examined
Ronnette Pulaski, as well?

97
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:57,159
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,484
There's no question in my mind
the same perpetrator

99
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:03,798
attacked both of them in that train car.

100
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:08,757
Doc, when, if ever,
will Ronnette be able to talk to us?

101
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:13,802
She had a severe head injury.
It's still early to tell.

102
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:18,802
Add to that the psychological impact
of the fear,

103
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:25,804
probably witnessing what was
happening to Laura before she...

104
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,763
So beautifuI.

105
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:40,079
Who would do a thing like that?

106
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,279
Leo.

107
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:50,883
Leo, honey, I have to go to work now
and Norma should be here any sec.

108
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,239
Leo.

109
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,685
Did you clean my boots?

110
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,241
Yeah, I did the laundry too.

111
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,763
All of it?

112
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,600
Well, yeah.

113
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,195
No, you didn't.

114
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:15,596
- OK, Leo, when I get home, I'll do it.
- Now, Shelly.

115
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:21,246
OK.

116
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:44,482
Blood.

117
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,763
Shelly, Norma's here.

118
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:54,478
Shelly, did you hear me say
Norma's here?

119
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:56,922
Yeah, I heard you, Leo.

120
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,482
I'm going to come by the diner today.

121
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,959
Be a good girl
and save me a piece of pie.

122
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,522
Sure, Leo.

123
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,922
James, you were arrested for suspicion
of the murder of Laura Palmer.

124
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,687
You have no previous
criminal record, correct?

125
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,160
Nothing, no, sir.

126
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,885
Did you shoot this video?

127
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,441
It's your cycle, isn't it?

128
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:02,604
Yes, sir. The three of us went
up there two Sundays ago.

129
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,682
James, you were in love with Laura.

130
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,197
The two of you were
seeing each other secretly.

131
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:15,883
No one else at school
or any of her friends knew about it.

132
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:19,841
She was the homecoming queen,
dating the captain of the football team,

133
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,965
how long did you think you
could keep this relationship secret?

134
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,645
It was secret
because that's the way she wanted it.

135
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:30,844
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

136
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:38,082
- I think so.
- So she was using cocaine?

137
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,686
- Yes.
- Did you ever use cocaine with her?

138
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:47,402
No. I tried to get her to stop.
And she did. For a while.

139
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,438
Why did she start again?

140
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:55,276
- Something happened two days ago.
- What? What happened?

141
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,763
I don't know.

142
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:03,284
I think something scared her because
she wouldn't see me or talk to me.

143
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,919
When did you last see her?

144
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,198
The night she died.

145
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,206
She snuck out of her house about 9:30.

146
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:25,082
About 12:30, I stopped the bike
at the light at Sparkwood and 21.

147
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:28,279
And she jumped off and ran away.

148
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,719
I didn't see her again.

149
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:39,924
Did you have a fight?

150
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:45,962
Not exactly. But she said
she couldn't see me anymore.

151
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,281
Why?

152
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,402
She didn't say.

153
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,119
Recognise this?

154
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,678
Yes, sir.

155
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,396
James, what happened on February 5th,

156
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:19,602
and who has the other half of this heart?

157
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,477
James, guess why I'm so happy today.

158
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:32,765
Because your skin is so soft
and you smell so good?

159
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:35,316
- No.
- Why?

160
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,926
Because I really believe
that you love me.

161
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,963
Now my heart belongs to you.

162
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,841
I don't know.

163
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,405
Damn it.

164
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,317
Where's that shirt?

165
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:14,358
No!

166
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:27,562
Hey, Bopper, since when does Leo
Johnson call me at my parents' house?

167
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:33,196
- Leo called you?
- Yesterday. He was looking for you.

168
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:37,076
He wanted to know where
the other half of the money was.

169
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,163
What did you tell him, Snake?

170
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,477
As far as I knew,
he didn't have any yet,

171
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,724
'cause I thought we were
supposed to give it to him today.

172
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:50,642
Yeah, well, I gave him half already.

173
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,998
When did you see him?

174
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:01,683
- Hey, I saw him the other night, OK?
- What night?

175
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,275
The night Laura died.

176
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,840
I saw Leo,

177
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:10,444
because I had this money burning
a $10,000 hole in my pocket.

178
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,837
What about the other half?

179
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:20,446
- It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
- So you didn't get it back from her?

180
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,440
She was supposed to hand it over
today, then she checked out.

181
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,679
So how are we supposed
to get ten grand for Leo?

182
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,605
Maybe we could
sell light bulbs door-to-door.

183
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,837
That's great. That's just...great.

184
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:35,084
- This isn't funny, Bobby.
- I'm not laughing.

185
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:39,035
We're lucky we're in jail. You know
what Leo will do when we get out.

186
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,356
Shut up.

187
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,644
Don't mention one word about Leo
Johnson. You do not know...

188
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,718
Leo Johnson.

189
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,442
Help me.

190
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,160
Mom.

191
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,445
Mom.

192
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,843
Hi, honey.

193
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,004
Why didn't you wake me?
I had to go to the Sheriff's office.

194
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,921
They called and said they could
wait until tomorrowto see you.

195
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,356
We thought you needed your rest.

196
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,315
You woke us crying in your sleep
last night. Do you remember?

197
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:02,996
No. Really?

198
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:07,240
I feel so badly for you. I'm so sorry.

199
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,597
Mom, it's so strange.

200
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:17,923
I know I should be sad
and I am, part of me is.

201
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,118
But it's like...

202
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:25,437
it's like I'm having
the most beautifuI dream

203
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,077
and the most terrible nightmare
all at once.

204
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:32,961
Your father said you saw
a boy named James Hurley last night.

205
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,636
- Is this to do with him?
- Can this be between you and me?

206
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,280
Of course.

207
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:43,878
James and Laura were seeing each
other the last two months.

208
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:48,643
I was the only one who knew about it.
James was so good for her.

209
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:53,039
You don't know howtroubled Laura
was. Last night I had to see him.

210
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:57,683
We were the two closest people
in the world to her.

211
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,561
- But I feel so bad now.
- Why, angel?

212
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:07,366
Because we realised...

213
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,876
that all this time...

214
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,599
we were the ones falling in love.

215
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:24,640
So I feel like
I've betrayed my best friend.

216
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,437
And if it's true...

217
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,486
then why am I so happy?

218
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,326
Oh, honey.

219
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,560
What do you want to do? Should we
see these guys separately or together?

220
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,480
- No, we can see them together.
- OK.

221
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,196
Hey, Ed, how's that coconut?

222
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:57,757
It's kind of tender,
but my pride hurts worse.

223
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:01,522
- This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.
- Pleasure.

224
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:05,566
- Any relation to James?
- I'm his uncle. He works in my garage.

225
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,082
His mother's away.
I'm looking after him.

226
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,242
- You plan on holding him?
- No.

227
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:15,679
- We can release him into your custody.
- Is James being charged?

228
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,760
I had one small doubt which
he cleared up. He didn't kill anybody.

229
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,277
But tell him to be careful,
we're releasing Mike and Bobby also.

230
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,719
- Will do.
- Agent Cooper.

231
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:30,284
I've got a call for you from a Mr Albert
Rosenfield. Sounds long distance.

232
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,403
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

233
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:38,045
It has that open air sound, you know,
like wind blowing through trees.

234
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,686
Yes.

235
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,686
About last night at the Roadhouse,
something's not right.

236
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:48,244
Seeing the bandage I thought maybe
Nadine caught wind of you and Norma.

237
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:52,042
If Nadine found out, I'd be playing
harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.

238
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,163
- True.
- I was with Norma.

239
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,642
But I was also on my stake-out.

240
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:59,116
I remember Mike and Bobby
grabbing Donna.

241
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:02,876
I got up to walk over,
and I got light-headed.

242
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:06,716
I was out on my feet before I got there.
I don't remember getting hit.

243
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:10,317
- What do you mean?
- I think my beer was drugged.

244
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,079
Jacques Renault was tending bar.

245
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:18,836
All right, Albert. You can
have the body all day tomorrow.

246
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:22,966
No, I can't do it. They're going
to put her in the ground on Monday.

247
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,806
If you come up through Lewis Fork,

248
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:30,284
I can recommend a place for lunch:
The Lamplighter Inn.

249
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:34,884
They got a cherry pie there
that'll kill you.

250
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:54,321
- Hi, Nadine.
- What are you doing here, Norma?

251
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:56,645
I might ask you the same.

252
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:01,557
And I'll tell you. I've gotten
all new drapes for my house.

253
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,042
Ed bought 'em for me
yesterday at Gentleman Jim's,

254
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,402
and we installed them together.

255
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,046
They're a beige sheer.

256
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:12,557
I was up all last night.
Do you know what I was doing?

257
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:14,755
No, I don't.

258
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:19,836
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner.

259
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:23,997
Do you know what makes it work?

260
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,282
The thing I thought
of at four this morning

261
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:31,521
when I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?

262
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,365
Cotton balls.

263
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:41,440
By God, those things
will be quiet now.

264
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:55,758
Did you have to post bail?

265
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,118
No. I had a talk with Harry.
There's no charge.

266
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:01,482
Mom still out of town?

267
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:04,957
Yeah, she's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.

268
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:09,120
I'll need help from the Bookhouse Boys.
Somebody's got to watch my back.

269
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,198
Already got it covered.

270
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:17,085
Hi, Mike, Bobby.

271
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,360
Before we start,
have you two got your story straight?

272
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:27,207
If we tell the truth, we don't
have to get our stories straight.

273
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:31,599
Besides, the Sheriff told us we're just in
here for fighting and it was self-defence.

274
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:36,325
Right. Well, I guess you can go then.

275
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,155
Now?

276
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,520
Oh, fellas, one more thing.

277
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,837
Pray for the safety of James Hurley,

278
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:53,637
because if anything happens to him,
we're coming for you.

279
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:00,165
Sheriff, what are you sitting around for?
We've got people to see.

280
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,926
- I'd better start studying medicine.
- Why?

281
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:07,080
Because I'm beginning
to feel a bit like Doctor Watson.

282
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,565
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

283
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:23,045
No, Josie, the expression
is "top of the morning".

284
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,675
And it's just barely morning.

285
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:33,797
Pete, I want to thank you for yesterday.

286
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,162
For standing up to me with Catherine.

287
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:42,283
Forget it. Catherine was wrong yesterday.
Period.

288
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,799
Thank you, anyway.

289
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:50,077
- Hello.
- Pete, it's Harry.

290
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:54,240
I've got Agent Cooper with me,
we're here to see Mrs Packard.

291
00:24:56,687 --> 00:25:00,362
I will make a fresh pot of coffee.

292
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:10,120
- Hi, Sheriff.
- Mrs Packard.

293
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:14,166
Dale Cooper, FBI. Remember him
from last night's town meeting?

294
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:15,879
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

295
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,277
Agent Cooper,
you remember Pete Martell.

296
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:19,840
You bet.

297
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,162
Can we offer you a cup of joe?

298
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,597
- You said the magic word.
- I'd love a cup.

299
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,440
I'll pour that for you.

300
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:32,162
Mr Cooper, how do you take it?

301
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,558
Black as midnight on a moonless night.

302
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,804
- Pretty black.
- Please sit down.

303
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,599
Thank you.

304
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,922
Mrs Packard,
I'll come straight to the point.

305
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,964
You hired Laura Palmer

306
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,965
to help you with your English, correct?

307
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:54,563
- Yes.
- When did you last see her?

308
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,362
Thursday afternoon.
About the time the mill blew five.

309
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:02,479
- That would be five o'clock?
- Yes.

310
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:06,765
- When did she leave?
- In an hour, when the lesson finished.

311
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:11,485
- I didn't see her again.
- How did she seem on Thursday?

312
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:17,722
Something was bothering her,
but we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it.

313
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:21,920
Something she said, though,
that stuck on my mind.

314
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:28,725
She said, "I think now I understand how
you feel about your husband's death."

315
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,163
Did she say
what that was in reference to?

316
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,843
No, but after what happened to her,

317
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:41,923
I can't help hearing it in my head,
like some haunting melody.

318
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,204
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

319
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:53,482
So, Harry,
how long you been seeing her?

320
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:58,919
How did you know?

321
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,003
Body language.

322
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:03,284
Jeez Louise!

323
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:08,561
Not long, six weeks.

324
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:12,998
Andrew died a year and a half ago.

325
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,883
Don't drink that.

326
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:25,644
You'd never guess.
There was a fish in the percolator.

327
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:31,640
Sorry.

328
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,639
Yes, Catherine, I'm listening.

329
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:47,887
You should know what your sentimental
shenanigans cost us yesterday.

330
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:49,884
You do know what shenanigans are?

331
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:56,675
Shutting down the mill
cost us $87,000 and change.

332
00:27:57,407 --> 00:28:01,525
You really think that would've made
brother Andrew happy?

333
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,877
Jocelyn... Mrs Packard.

334
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:35,835
What is "shenanigans"?

335
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:40,883
Nonsense, mischief,
often a deceitful or treacherous trick.

336
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:50,196
- Why do you always have to rush off?
- It's been over an hour.

337
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:54,758
There was a time when
we used to take the whole afternoon.

338
00:28:54,927 --> 00:29:00,638
In the sweetness of passing time,
this hour will soon seem like a day.

339
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,639
Sing it to somebody else.

340
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:07,436
I'm no pea-brained chambermaid
looking for a tumble in the broom closet.

341
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:11,926
Sorry, didn't mean to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

342
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:16,916
Oh, no, my mistake. I'd gotten used to
our conducting business and pleasure.

343
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:21,837
Sweetheart, it's all the same to me.

344
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:25,519
Don't sweetheart me, you old dog.

345
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,037
I'm no schoolgirl, either.

346
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,925
What's the next step?
Do we escalate?

347
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:36,278
We may not have to do anything.

348
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:39,405
A few more local tragedies,

349
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:43,606
and Josie might just run the old mill
into the ground by herself.

350
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:48,636
At the rate we're going, it's going to be
years before the mill's bankrupt.

351
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,405
I don't want to wait any longer.

352
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:54,321
Besides, my knothead husband
may peek in the ledger

353
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,120
and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

354
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:02,440
Maybe it's time to start a little fire.

355
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,242
Are you talking business or pleasure?

356
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:10,925
I'm talking about the Packard sawmill.

357
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:19,323
All that dry timber lying around...

358
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:22,846
A stray spark...

359
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:24,880
one night...

360
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:29,404
Some night when Pete's off
on a toot with Smokey the bear.

361
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:35,761
Now I remember how all those hours...

362
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:38,957
turned into days.

363
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:53,765
Sarah, darling,

364
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,840
I'm sorry to disturb you, sweetheart,

365
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,037
but Donna Hayward is here.

366
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,839
Take this now.

367
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,122
I'll send her in.

368
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,886
- Try not to upset her.
- OK.

369
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:28,516
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

370
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:34,682
I miss her so much.

371
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:41,242
- Do you miss her?
- Yes, I miss her so much.

372
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:46,955
I miss her so much.

373
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:52,877
I miss her so much.
I miss her so much.

374
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:11,840
Laura! Oh, Laura, my baby.
Oh, Laura, my baby.

375
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:27,320
- Sarah! Sarah!
- Leland! Leland!

376
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:33,275
It's all right, sweetheart, it's all right.

377
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:37,400
Calm down.
Calm down, sweetheart, please.

378
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,355
So neither of you saw
Ronnette after school that day?

379
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,121
That's right.

380
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:52,926
As far as you know,
she went to her job?

381
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:56,403
Yes, Horne's department store
downtown.

382
00:32:56,567 --> 00:33:00,082
What did she do
at the department store?

383
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,518
She was a...

384
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,878
a salesgirl at the perfume counter.

385
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:14,205
She used to joke it was the sweetest
smelling job she'd ever had.

386
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:26,241
Excuse me.

387
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:43,076
How many times have I asked you not
to disturb the guests with this racket?

388
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,083
About 4,000.

389
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,798
Audrey.

390
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:06,125
Julie tells me that you were in
with the Norwegians,

391
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:10,758
just before they all suddenly decided,
en masse,

392
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,959
to return to the old country...

393
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:18,725
without signing the contracts.

394
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:20,883
Is that true?

395
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:22,924
Yes.

396
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,927
You wouldn't have done
or said anything

397
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:31,956
that might have precipitated their
evacuation, would you?

398
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:37,759
I mean, I'm assuming
that this was just a coincidence.

399
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:43,598
Daddy, I did go in there to check out
that ridiculous smorgasbord.

400
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:50,880
And while I was in there,
I happened to mention that I was sad.

401
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:54,998
About what?

402
00:35:56,647 --> 00:36:00,481
About my dear, close friend
Laura being brutally murdered.

403
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,122
Do you realise

404
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:13,798
the kind of money that your little
performance just cost this family?

405
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:18,485
If you ever pull another stunt like that,

406
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:22,395
you'll be scrubbing bidets
in a Bulgarian convent.

407
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,802
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.

408
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,995
Laura died two days ago.

409
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,116
I lost you years ago.

410
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:59,200
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

411
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,407
I was hoping we'd have the chance

412
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,523
to discuss the recent events.

413
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:08,518
Not necessarily
the physical events themselves,

414
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:12,037
but rather the thoughts and feelings
surrounding them.

415
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:18,001
Rebellion in a young man your age
is a necessary fact of life,

416
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,442
candidly, a sign of strength.

417
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:25,123
In other words, Robert,
I respect your rebellious nature.

418
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:30,323
But, as your father, I'm obligated
to contain that fire of contrariness

419
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:35,282
within the bounds established by society
and within our own family structure.

420
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:42,121
I note your reluctance
to enter into a dialogue with me.

421
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:48,043
There are times when silence is golden.
Silence can be taken many ways.

422
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:54,555
As a sign of intelligence. The quieter
we become, the more we hear.

423
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:02,158
Now, I am a tolerant man,
but my patience has its limits.

424
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:05,404
"To have his path made clear is
the aspiration of every human being

425
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:09,446
"in our beclouded
and tempestuous existence."

426
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:13,640
Robert, you and I are going
to work to make yours real clear.

427
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,521
We're here for you, Bobby.

428
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:31,517
Anything to go with that, Sheriff?

429
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:35,123
Agent Cooper might want to try
a slice of that pie.

430
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:37,841
- Cherry pie?
- Best in the Tri-Counties.

431
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:43,516
- Could you ask Norma to stop by?
- Sure thing.

432
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:46,724
Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.

433
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:51,523
I can't get rid of the taste
of that fish-filtered coffee.

434
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,558
Me neither.

435
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,358
Shelly Johnson with a "J"?

436
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:02,165
Husband's a trucker, Leo.
Minor rap sheet.

437
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,526
- Log lady.
- Right.

438
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:15,000
Hi.

439
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:17,846
Can I ask her about her log?

440
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,237
Many have.

441
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,166
- Evening.
- Norma.

442
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,239
I'd like you to meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

443
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,444
- FBI.
- Norma Jennings.

444
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:33,804
Did Laura Palmer help you
with the meals-on-wheels programme,

445
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,446
delivering to the elderly?

446
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,201
Yeah, Laura helped
organise that programme.

447
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,756
Do you have a list of
the people on her route?

448
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,361
- I can get them.
- Would you?

449
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:46,684
And two more pieces
of this incredible pie.

450
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:50,398
OK.

451
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:55,197
Man, oh, man, you must have
the metabolism of a bumblebee.

452
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:02,485
For your information, I heard you
speaking about Laura Palmer...

453
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,245
Yes?

454
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:08,798
One day, my log
will have something to say about this.

455
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,680
My log saw something that night.

456
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,241
Really? What did it see?

457
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:17,884
Ask it.

458
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,486
I thought so.

459
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:36,559
Thanks, Norma.
See you tomorrow.

460
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:52,481
Hi, Leo. I brought you some pie.

461
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:58,846
Where's my shirt?

462
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:01,446
What shirt?

463
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,487
My favourite blue shirt.

464
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:09,278
It's the second this year.

465
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:13,166
I'm going to teach you a lesson

466
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:16,080
about looking after my property.

467
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:21,243
- This is going to hurt you.
- Please, Leo. No. No.

468
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:31,399
I'll get it.

469
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,883
Come on.

470
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:44,758
Mom, Dad,
this is James, James Hurley.

471
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:46,758
- How do you do, James?
- Sir.

472
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:50,237
- Mrs Hayward.
- Nice to meet you, James.

473
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:54,835
Well, I hope you're hungry.
Eileen's been cooking up a storm.

474
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:56,963
Yes, sir.

475
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:58,560
Like a drink?

476
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:02,879
We have some soft drinks, some
fruit punch and some sparkling cider.

477
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:05,680
Fruit punch,
that would be good, thank you.

478
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:07,877
- I'll get it.
- OK.

479
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:13,201
Why don't you fellas sit down
at the table and I'll check on the roast.

480
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:28,245
- Your fruit punch.
- Thanks, Donna.

481
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:30,841
I don't believe I know your parents.

482
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,239
No, sir. My dad died when
I was 10, and my mom travels a lot.

483
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,716
She writes for the paper sometimes.

484
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,759
Ed Hurley down at the gas farm
is James's uncle.

485
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:43,885
His wife's the lady with the patch.

486
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:48,598
Yes, sir. That's my aunt Nadine.
She's a real character.

487
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:52,476
Bill, could you give me a hand, please.

488
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,524
Excuse me.

489
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:01,881
- We can talk after dinner.
- It's good to see you.

490
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,883
It's good to see you, too.

491
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:23,478
That bastard.

492
00:43:23,607 --> 00:43:26,246
First your girlfriend, then mine.

493
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:32,117
Too bad we can only kill him once.

494
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:41,765
Hey, what's up, Doc? It's Laura Palmer,
in case you haven't guessed.

495
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,875
I'm making you another tape,

496
00:43:45,007 --> 00:43:51,196
which, as you already know, I've
mailed you in one of your envelopes.

497
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:55,963
It's Thursday the 23rd,
and I am so bored.

498
00:43:56,127 --> 00:44:00,882
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

499
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:07,766
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

500
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:12,084
I should've met you a long time ago,
Doctor Jacoby,

501
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:16,843
'cause right now
I can take just so much of sweet.

502
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:23,355
I just know I'm going to get lost in those
woods again tonight. I just know it.

503
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:29,477
Remember me telling you
about that mystery man, well...
