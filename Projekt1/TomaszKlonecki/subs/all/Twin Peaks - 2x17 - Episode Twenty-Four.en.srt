1
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:47,713
One of Norma's breakfasts.
Made special.

2
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,086
God bless Norma.

3
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,121
Maybe later. Maybe later, thanks.

4
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,959
How's things at the station?

5
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,756
Earle's chess game
is the big concern.

6
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,297
The man has a poor sense
of recreation.

7
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,401
Yeah.

8
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,629
We're holding up, for now.

9
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,475
Hey, you and Cooper can handle it.
lt's a pretty simple town.

10
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,406
Used to be.

11
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:29,351
l guess the world's
just caught up to us.

12
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,176
Annie.

13
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,315
- Hi.
- Hi.

14
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,647
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.

15
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:07,850
Hi, Annie. Welcome.
Norma's told me all about you.

16
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:13,059
- All about me?
- Shelly's like family.

17
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,532
With our family, that's not exactly
a character reference.

18
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,536
How did you and Mom get along?

19
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:22,675
Well, we can talk about her,
or we can feel good about things.

20
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,537
l vote for plan B.

21
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:28,647
Me too. l'm glad you're here.

22
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,181
Feels a little strange. The real world.

23
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,081
Little things, like l'd almost forgotten
how to use money.

24
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,485
Closest we get in the convent
was bingo chips.

25
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,055
No charity, Norma. Promise.

26
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:45,823
Don't worry,
l'm gonna work you till you drop.

27
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,262
Compelling.

28
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,293
Harry's about to hit bottom.

29
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:18,889
ls he eating?

30
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,261
When do you think
he'll come back to work?

31
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,167
l guess we'll find out soon.

32
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,199
Need a hand?

33
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,367
That's a question
l should be asking you.

34
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,307
You're the senior lawman, Cooper.

35
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,813
Let's just let the rain fall
as it has been.

36
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,543
Besides, l hate paperwork.

37
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:43,815
This is worse than the Bureau,
with all its international documentation.

38
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,982
Eckhardt, Josie...

39
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,490
This is the autopsy on her.

40
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,756
Doc Hayward said
he couldn't determine cause of death.

41
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:55,833
The body only weighed 65 pounds.

42
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,604
- How is that possible?
- l don't know.

43
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:02,833
Maybe something to do with
what l saw in the room when she died.

44
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,410
Maybe we'd better just whistle
on our way past the graveyard.

45
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,907
- Yeah.
- Anything on Earle?

46
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:16,278
Trail's stone-cold.
Still waiting for his response.

47
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,800
- Slip.
- Slippers.

48
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,308
You know, Leo,
you can't really appreciate

49
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,784
how tonic country life is
until you're actually right here, living it.

50
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,280
- Pipe?
- Splendid.

51
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,887
Even if you've been
to the country before,

52
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:00,226
when you try to imagine
what it would be like to go back,

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,891
the image is imperfect.

54
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,699
The mental image
is always imperfect.

55
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,035
Am l right?

56
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:14,138
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo.

57
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:18,306
Your silence speaks volumes.

58
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:24,913
Or if not volumes, at least the
occasional unpunctuated paragraph.

59
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:32,290
Well, let's see what move our poor
Cooper's come up with this time.

60
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,614
This isn't a move.

61
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,514
This is a trick.

62
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,584
He's playing a stalemate game.

63
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:02,424
Cooper doesn't know
the meaning of stalemate!

64
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,457
He's getting help.

65
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:16,538
l cannot tolerate people
who do not play by the rules.

66
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:20,410
People who shirk the standards!

67
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:29,878
Many people are going to regret this.

68
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,956
Got it?

69
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:14,098
Ladies, may l say,

70
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:19,330
you'll both delightfully represent

71
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:23,669
the sanctity of nature.

72
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:25,868
Cigarette?

73
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,981
l prefer to keep my chest clear.

74
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,710
The great god, fitness.

75
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,621
- Have you spoken with Pinkle?
- What's a Pinkle?

76
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,282
He's giving a talk
on the pine-weasel.

77
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:45,022
- The endangered animal.
- Oh, lovely.

78
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,291
What is it? A raccoon or something?

79
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,230
A ferret.

80
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,459
Audrey?

81
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,628
Oh, great.
You two should coordinate.

82
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,205
You are dreaming.

83
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,570
Hello.

84
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,113
Looks like you're trying
to run lumber upstream.

85
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,513
How can l help you, Mr. Wheeler?

86
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:08,279
Horne. Well, the talk
that we had at dinner.

87
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,581
- l can't--
- l'm sorry l was rude, wasn't l?

88
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,749
Just that when it comes to my family,
l get a little excitable.

89
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,293
- Who am l to waltz in out of nowhere?
- We need help, anyone can see that,

90
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:19,795
and l can't think of anyone
better qualified for the job than you.

91
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,863
Hello?

92
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,636
What are we talking about anyway?

93
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,796
l was apologizing
and you were apologizing.

94
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:31,135
We're both real sorry about something.
You wanna go out somewhere?

95
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,769
Bad time, right? lt's not good?

96
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,437
Oh, no, no, it's great.

97
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,442
How about a picnic?

98
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,515
We need outdoors stuff.
A basket, blanket...

99
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,717
Food.

100
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,158
l don't know how to cook.

101
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,092
l'll bet you someone
in the kitchen does.

102
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,429
This is just to show people
what the pine-weasel looks like.

103
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,829
l understand the concept perfectly,
Mr. Dinkle.

104
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,559
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.

105
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,173
But what l'm trying to make clear
is that using a stuffed animal

106
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:04,469
to represent an endangered species
as an ecological protest

107
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:08,808
constitutes the supreme incongruity.

108
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,648
Well, that's clear, Dick.

109
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,850
Harry?

110
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,651
Hey, Coop.

111
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,660
We got Josie's dossier
in from lnterpol.

112
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,030
Not interested.

113
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
ln addition to killing Eckhardt,
trying to kill me

114
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,135
- and killing Jonathan in Seattle,
- Closed cases.

115
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:35,138
she's also wanted for a variety
of felonies in Hong Kong.

116
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,639
l don't need to hear this.

117
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,277
She's also had
two prostitution arrests, Harry.

118
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:55,528
Harry, eventually it's gonna help you
to know she was a hardened criminal.

119
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,629
A killer.

120
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,356
Get out of here.

121
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,695
l know it's not easy right now.

122
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,000
Just get out of here.

123
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,370
Get out of here! Go!

124
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,388
The door was open.

125
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,234
A country habit. We're all so trusting.

126
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:41,172
My name is Jones.

127
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,865
l was executive assistant
to the late Mr. Eckhardt.

128
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,915
Thank you.

129
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:03,751
l've come to expedite the transport
of his body back to Hong Kong.

130
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:11,161
Tragic, what happened.
You know, he really did love Josie.

131
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,436
Didn't we all?

132
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,701
They're going to be buried
side by side.

133
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:21,104
So they can keep an eye
on each other.

134
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,911
l guess you have your reasons
to be bitter.

135
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:28,279
Oh, just call me a healthy skeptic.

136
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:32,212
Now, why did you really
come to see me?

137
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:38,090
l came here to give you a gift.
May l?

138
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,129
l don't think so.

139
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,701
Slowly.

140
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,346
From Thomas.

141
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:09,287
l have a few things to tidy up,
then l'll be leaving tonight.

142
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,996
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.

143
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:32,484
Excuse me, l'm looking
for Bill or Eileen Hayward.

144
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,518
Well, they're not here right now.
Can l help you?

145
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,952
Well, l'm Dr. Gerald Craig,

146
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,888
an old friend of Will's
from medical school.

147
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,154
And, well, you see,
l have a convention in Spokane

148
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,858
and so l just thought l'd swing by
and surprise them.

149
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,366
Which daughter are you?

150
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,866
- Donna.
- Donna.

151
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,701
Would you like to come in,
Dr. Craig?

152
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:00,039
l'd appreciate that.

153
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,596
Can l get you something to drink,
Dr. Craig? A pop or something?

154
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,493
Thank you, no, no.

155
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,533
ls this your local paper?

156
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,432
Yeah. Pretty small town, huh?

157
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,006
Now, don't knock small towns
until you've lived in the city.

158
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,040
Donna, you know,

159
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,944
it seems like Will has found himself
a little piece of heaven here.

160
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:42,520
Now, don't you have two sisters?

161
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:47,022
- Yeah, they're younger than me.
- Are they both as beautiful as you?

162
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,354
Well, l don't know.

163
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:56,595
You know, your dad and l,
we used to sit around

164
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,432
and try to figure
how our lives would work out.

165
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:06,567
And it seems like he's come
a little closer to the mark than l have.

166
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,814
- You're in high school?
- Unfortunately.

167
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,645
l felt exactly the same way.

168
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:16,481
You know, high school is difficult,
you know.

169
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,147
You have no idea
what you want to do with your life,

170
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,987
so it seems that absolutely none of it
applies to your life.

171
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,130
You're right.

172
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,895
Well, don't worry. lt'll all work out.

173
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:32,629
For now, you just enjoy it
in all its absurdity.

174
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,568
Okay.

175
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,904
Oh, l have a small gift for your dad.

176
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:44,277
Now, can l trust you not to open it?

177
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,247
Sure.

178
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,913
You know, speaking of school,

179
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,854
Will and l graduated
30 years ago this month.

180
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:57,018
So l--
lt's a small remembrance for him.

181
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:59,858
Well, l should be on my way.

182
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:03,934
Oh, this is the number
where l'm staying.

183
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,538
l hope to see you later, Donna.

184
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,539
Me too.

185
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,717
How are you holding up, Pete?

186
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:59,052
l've been through every
stalemate game in recorded history.

187
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:03,559
And l've jerry-rigged
a few of these country standoffs

188
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,856
that they don't write about in books.

189
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,400
But it's no use. l mean,
there isn't a stalemate game on earth

190
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:15,006
that you don't lose
at least a few foot soldiers.

191
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,971
l mean, the classic Herbstman.

192
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:22,207
You wind up with six pieces.
Now, l can improve on that.

193
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:26,715
But even if l get there in half the time
and wind up with 1 2,

194
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,023
that means six people die.

195
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,717
Do your best, Pete.

196
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:40,059
Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatience.

197
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:43,759
He doesn't want pawns.
He wants royalty.

198
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:47,565
Protect those, particularly the queen,
and we can frustrate him.

199
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,231
You can't do that.

200
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,369
My students.

201
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:57,476
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight
without doing the little hook thing.

202
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,483
You don't have to do
the little hook thing. That's optional.

203
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:06,751
Andy, the knight
has to do the little hook thing.

204
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:10,259
- Every time?
- lt's a privilege.

205
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,523
No one else gets to make that move.

206
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,791
Okay, Mr. Martell.

207
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:24,071
l guess some people don't know
quite as much as they think they do.

208
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:27,305
Check.

209
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,956
We thought it best
we come see you.

210
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,930
As you know, that pattern
on the back of my neck

211
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,627
appeared during my experience
with...

212
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:55,205
Of course,
no idea as to how it got there.

213
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,274
And you noticed it today?

214
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:00,844
My log noticed. l remember.

215
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,605
What do you remember, Margaret?

216
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,850
Look at the back of my leg.

217
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:21,166
l was 7 years old.

218
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,995
l went walking up in the woods,

219
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:29,732
and when l got back, l was told
that l had disappeared for a day.

220
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:32,844
All l could recall was a flash of light,

221
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:36,715
and that mark was on my leg.

222
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,851
We all three recall the light.

223
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:44,152
And also, the call of the owl.

224
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,225
Yes, l remember.

225
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:52,592
The only other time l saw that sight
and heard that sound

226
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:56,098
was right before my husband died.

227
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,327
ln the fire.

228
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:11,039
- l'm connecting with something.
- Yes.

229
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,047
What?

230
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,252
l don't know.

231
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:22,525
Oh, bury me not

232
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:28,292
On the old prairie
Where the coyotes howl

233
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:31,527
And the wind blows free

234
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:37,475
ln a narrow grave,
Six-by-3

235
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:41,077
Don't bury me now

236
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:44,443
On the lone prairie

237
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,612
No one's ever sung a song
to me before.

238
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,582
You must have been serenaded
at least once or twice.

239
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:58,996
l don't inspire much singing.

240
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,460
Most boys are afraid.

241
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,263
Well, they don't know you then.

242
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,673
Not really.

243
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,004
l don't think
anybody really knows me.

244
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,407
lt sounds like a warning.

245
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,447
l know.

246
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,518
lf there's another guy...

247
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,518
There was someone,
but not anymore.

248
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:31,593
There's nobody.

249
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,131
So, what do you wanna do now?

250
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,231
Know anymore cowboy tricks?

251
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:44,434
lf you've got a lariat
in that picnic basket,

252
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,168
l could lasso passing cattle.

253
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,547
l don't think there's a cow for miles.

254
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,945
Stray dogs, raccoons,
birds, weasels.

255
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:21,570
You had a visitor.

256
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,304
Who's that?

257
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:27,885
Somebody you went to medical school
with named Gerald Craig.

258
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:32,585
Gerald Craig?
That's not possible, Donna.

259
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:36,885
Well, yeah. He said he was on his way
to a convention in Spokane.

260
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,393
He knew everything about me.

261
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:49,165
Here's his number, and this.

262
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:57,105
Gerald Craig was my roommate.

263
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:00,376
He drowned on a rafting trip
on the Snake River.

264
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,544
l was there, Donna.
l tried to save him.

265
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,014
Well, then...

266
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:08,925
lt's a cemetery.

267
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,871
Knight to King's Bishop 3.

268
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,735
That man, he's very dangerous.

269
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,879
Don't let him in here again,
do you understand?

270
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:32,039
- Sure.
- l've got to take this to Cooper.

271
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:44,392
Nadine, what l'm here
to say to you is...

272
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,563
Seeing how you're with Mike now...

273
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,398
lt's so cute the way
you get embarrassed.

274
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:58,375
And since
l have found someone else...

275
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,911
Nadine, l'm not sure
you're gonna understand this.

276
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,674
Of course, l understand, Eddie.

277
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:08,011
This isn't just a little spat.

278
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:10,246
Nadine,

279
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:13,925
do you know
what Ed is suggesting?

280
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:19,325
lt's not too obvious.
We're not, like, talking relativity here.

281
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:23,867
We're breaking up.
Major, final breakup.

282
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:29,030
Well, yes, technically,
l guess it is a breakup, but--

283
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,972
Well, it's a little more
than that, Nadine.

284
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:35,477
Ed, you are so serious.

285
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,673
These are the dating years.

286
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:42,309
You're acting like
this is some really big deal.

287
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:43,886
Doc?

288
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:50,017
Ed, there are no secret tricks
or magic words.

289
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:55,394
lt's like the dissolving
of scar tissue around a wound.

290
00:25:55,567 --> 00:26:01,301
She'll start to see reality again
when her mind begins to feel safe.

291
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,634
Well, when will that be?

292
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,538
l can't say.

293
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:08,305
That tissue's packed in there
pretty hard.

294
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,315
Okay. Well, one thing
l really don't wanna see, Ed,

295
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:19,185
are any incidents with Mike.
No jealous rages.

296
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:23,192
Well, maybe just one.

297
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,353
l give up.

298
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:34,604
Nadine, you and Ed
are about to get a divorce.

299
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,109
l think l've gone blind in my left eye.

300
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:38,125
- Shelly?
- Yeah.

301
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,299
Have you seen this?

302
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,133
Oh, ''Miss Twin Peaks.''

303
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,113
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

304
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,749
There's a cash prize
and a scholarship.

305
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,946
- l bet you could walk away with it.
- l don't think so.

306
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,248
lt's easy, you give a speech,
you answer a few questions...

307
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:05,425
Miss Double R Diner, what would
you do to bring about world peace?

308
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:10,091
Well, l would bring
all the world leaders together,

309
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:13,431
make them form a circle
and join hands.

310
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,597
Because you can't make a fist
holding hands.

311
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:17,969
You're a shoo-in.

312
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,434
l have an order up.

313
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,290
Here's your burger.

314
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,320
What's with the dance?

315
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,863
Oh, my boss told me l should
enter a pageant. Miss Twin Peaks.

316
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:44,631
You can kid about it,
but you are very pretty.

317
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,236
l think you should enter it.

318
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,306
Thanks, but l don't think
of myself as pretty.

319
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,465
lt's an inner thing, you know.

320
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,220
Would you like something to drink?

321
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:14,855
Yes, l'd like a cup
of deep black joe please.

322
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:17,232
Coming right up.

323
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,443
You must be Norma's sister.

324
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,273
l'm Annie.

325
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:33,214
- How did you know?
- Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.

326
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,016
Must keep you pretty busy.

327
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,886
Sure does.

328
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,784
Are you staying in town for a while?

329
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:45,795
l might be here quite a while.

330
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,192
lt's happened to me.

331
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,190
Looks like it's grown on you.

332
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,536
lt has a way of doing that.

333
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:07,751
l made it a little strong.

334
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,247
Okay.

335
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,001
You made it just right, Annie.

336
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,710
We've got a problem
at the Book House.

337
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,418
Agent Cooper, Hawk,
the sheriff's gone off.

338
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:50,117
He's broken every piece
of furniture not nailed down.

339
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:52,160
l honestly don't know what to do.

340
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,457
lt's okay, Andy.

341
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,999
Hey, Deputy Dale.

342
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,238
How's business?

343
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:10,740
Well, Harry,
it's a little complicated at the moment.

344
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,153
That's a good thing about the law,
it doesn't breathe, you can't kill it!

345
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:26,195
Harry, l've got an idea.

346
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:29,295
Why don't you hand me that gun.

347
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:42,778
l don't believe l've ever handed my gun
over to anybody in my entire life!

348
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:47,310
This might be
a damn fine time to start.

349
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,891
You know something else
l've never done?

350
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:59,353
l've never crossed the ocean.

351
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,198
Never got to China.

352
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:10,038
She came to me.

353
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,073
And she made everything better.

354
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,207
Everything so much better.

355
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:24,917
Harry.

356
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:29,688
Your life is still your own.
Josie didn't take that with her.

357
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,886
l should have gotten her away.

358
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:35,032
l should have
taken her away from here!

359
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:41,698
l loved her.

360
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:47,240
She didn't have to die.

361
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,362
l don't understand.

362
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,229
There's a whole lot l don't understand.

363
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,466
We're all like that.

364
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,624
Have somebody keep an eye
on him tonight.

365
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,158
l've never seen him like this.

366
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:39,092
lt was like taking a hike
to your favorite spot

367
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:42,256
and finding a hole
where the lake used to be.

368
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,701
Josie had power.

369
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:49,837
A man who doesn't love easily,
loves too much.

370
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:53,444
- A good man.
- The best.

371
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:56,505
Keep going.

372
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:05,619
That's a special honeymoon suite
for Mr. and Mrs. Hinkman?

373
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,951
That's correct. Yes.

374
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,787
We're from Bozeman originally.

375
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:13,988
But my wife thought that it would be
nice to see the countryside.

376
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:17,430
And, you know, you have some
very pretty country here in Twin Peaks.

377
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,501
- Will you be with us long?
- Not long enough.

378
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:26,736
No, just until tomorrow if that's okay,
because we're going deep sea fishing.

379
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,537
Oh, goody.

380
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:31,648
Okay, so we'll just be
going on up now, me and--

381
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,250
- Me and Mrs. Hinkman.
- Oh, is that Mike?

382
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:41,249
Susan, how are you?

383
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,225
Fine.

384
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:47,095
l'll see you at school.

385
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,767
The room please.

386
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:57,000
l think we can handle the bags.

387
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,538
First of all,

388
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:09,620
l would like to thank all of you
for this marvelous turnout.

389
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:12,086
lt's very gratifying to see
so many people

390
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:18,059
who are sincere
about their environment.

391
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:23,792
The Stop Ghostwood campaign
is a determined effort

392
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:28,029
to keep the rabid development
interests from trying to turn

393
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:33,041
our beautiful Northwest forests
into a monstrous amusement park.

394
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:38,581
Destroying animal preserves which
have been undisturbed for centuries.

395
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,208
The little worlds
that serve as sanctums

396
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:45,788
for several endangered species.

397
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:52,294
Not the least of which
is the little pine-weasel.

398
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,761
Before moving along,

399
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:03,631
l would just like to remind all of us
that ecology is not a luxury science.

400
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:07,073
lt is not about
pleasant appearances.

401
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:11,113
lt is about survival.

402
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:18,586
About whether we are all
going to make it, period.

403
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:26,190
But not to understate the value
of visual pleasure,

404
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:30,596
we come to the fashion show.

405
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:35,933
Now, if any of you think you recognize
some of the models,

406
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:39,270
it's because they are concerned
members of the community,

407
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,810
who have graciously given
of their time tonight.

408
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,643
So, ladies and gentlemen,
to kick things off, here is our host,

409
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:47,444
Richard Tremayne.

410
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:56,290
Thank you. Splendid gathering.

411
00:36:56,461 --> 00:37:00,124
Our little Lucy
is wearing a delightful

412
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:04,997
mix of warm, northern comfort
and southern insouciance.

413
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:10,402
An elegant worsted wool jacket
over a plethora of plaid,

414
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:13,475
with a hint of polka dot.

415
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:18,414
lt's fabulous, isn't it?
A moonless night, black, slim skirt

416
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:24,054
with a look that always says,
''Hey, world, l'm here.''

417
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:39,495
Mr. Brennan is wearing
a fire engine red turtleneck

418
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:43,232
beneath an all-wool plaid
Pendleton shirt.

419
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:48,402
He completes this look with his red
and black, buffalo-checked jodhpurs.

420
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,673
For the man who wants
to make a statement

421
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:56,343
while retaining that casual feel,
whether he's out mastering a task,

422
00:37:56,521 --> 00:38:00,651
or riding the breeze
of a chance meeting.

423
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:03,553
That's it, Andy.

424
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,195
At this rate, we're running late.
So if we could all sort

425
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:18,103
of hurry Richard along
with some quick movement out there.

426
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:19,300
l'm hot in this thing.

427
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:24,107
You're hot? l'm dressed like a sheep.
All this worsted.

428
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,613
And l think Mr. Tremayne

429
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:28,445
is getting more than a little hot
with all these girls.

430
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,384
- Our next model...
- Go, go, go.

431
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:37,286
Well, if it isn't John Muir,
friend of the redwoods.

432
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:40,727
Catherine, how good of you to come.

433
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,425
Ben, darling,
who are you kidding with all this?

434
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:49,301
l am absolutely 1 00 percent sincere.

435
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:52,932
Oh, come on.
Look who you're talking to.

436
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,278
We're in the same line of work.

437
00:38:56,447 --> 00:39:01,908
You've always been
a little more obvious, but this.

438
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:06,580
Catherine, have you ever,
in your entire life,

439
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:10,125
had an experience
that truly changed you?

440
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:14,424
Please, spare me the born-again
sales pitch and level with me.

441
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,124
You can't hope to stop
my development plans,

442
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,826
so, what do you actually expect
to gain from all this?

443
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,141
A first scrubbing

444
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:29,336
on one of the dirtiest consciences
in the entire Northwest.

445
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:33,473
And hopefully, it will happen to you.

446
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,679
Catherine,

447
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,291
l know what your plans
for Ghostwood are.

448
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:46,158
And granted l used to see life
exactly the way you do.

449
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:51,567
And no matter how many deals
l made or how much money l made,

450
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:57,469
inside, l was still a black,
miserable clod of dirt.

451
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:03,012
l am finding that the one thing
that really affords you joy in life,

452
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:07,584
the only authentic thing, is giving.

453
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,983
Don't wait until you're on
your deathbed to find that out.

454
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:15,682
God help you.

455
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,386
You actually sound like you mean it.

456
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:27,032
l do. For you, for me, the future.

457
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:33,606
Catherine,
why don't you take this opportunity

458
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:39,215
to transcend a lifetime
of megalomania and egocentricity,

459
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:44,844
and write us a big fat check
to help stop Ghostwood.

460
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,935
And now, to introduce you
to an endangered little critter,

461
00:41:04,108 --> 00:41:05,769
whose home
is presently under attack

462
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:11,108
by the proposed Ghostwood
development project, Mr. Tim Pinkle.

463
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:17,045
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:23,290
Well, hi, how's everything going?

465
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:29,723
That's good.

466
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:33,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
l have with me a little fellow

467
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:38,772
who doesn't understand
the peril that awaits him.

468
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:42,970
An innocent in a world gone mad.

469
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:46,776
A world gone mad.

470
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:51,115
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

471
00:41:53,591 --> 00:42:00,326
l give you
the endangered pine-weasel.

472
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:04,931
Now, this species
is of the weasel family.

473
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:12,372
And not only is he non-aggressive
to us humans and has beautiful fur,

474
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:18,482
but also, he is by nature
an excellent controller of rodents.

475
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:23,450
Unfortunately, this little friendly fellow
is incredibly curious

476
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:27,182
making him very easy
for one to trap.

477
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,556
He is also attracted to bright
shiny objects.

478
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:34,857
- Must be my studs.
- Yeah.

479
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,794
lt also is amazing,
he is particularly attracted

480
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,736
to various smells like, believe it or not,
very cheap cologne.

481
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,840
Oh, what's this?

482
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,000
l think it wants
to give you a kiss, Dick.

483
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:50,306
- Oh, please, Mr. Pinkle.
- Come on. Come on.

484
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:56,376
- lt's all right, give him a kiss.
- A kiss?

485
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:58,988
Attaboy. Come on.

486
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:02,148
Hello, there, little pilgrim--

487
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,553
Oh, no, no, no.

488
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:17,405
Nobody panic. Don't panic.
He's completely harmless.

489
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:18,735
He's already endangered.

490
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,720
Don't panic, anybody,
just don't panic.

491
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,224
- Nobody panic.
- Please everyone, calm down.

492
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:39,625
Stay in your seat.

493
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:44,296
- You all right?
- l'm fine.

494
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,367
Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.

495
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:48,903
- Maybe we should help.
- l don't know.

496
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,769
A little excitement
might do this crowd some good.

497
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:56,608
- Did you come for the fashion show?
- No, l came for you.
