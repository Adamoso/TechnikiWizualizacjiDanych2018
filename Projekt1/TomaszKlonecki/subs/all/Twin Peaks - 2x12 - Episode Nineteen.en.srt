1
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,459
Mr. Horne?

2
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,105
Mr. Horne?

3
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,276
Your secretary said to come in.

4
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,282
Bobby Briggs.

5
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,217
Bobby, you know
what you have to have in this life?

6
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:27,757
Balance.

7
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,753
Distance.

8
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,699
Symmetry.

9
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,564
Look.

10
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,807
lt's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

11
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,011
Mr. Horne, did you listen
to that tape that l sent you?

12
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,018
Yes, l listened to your tape, Bobby.

13
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:00,818
Frankly, l am surprised
that Leo could master the technology.

14
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,425
Damn it, Bobby, what do you want?

15
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:11,459
Mr. Horne,
l have a great admiration for you.

16
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:14,834
Admiration is for poets
and dairy cows, Bobby.

17
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:19,274
l don't know what you mean. l...

18
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,674
Bobby.

19
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:29,312
You're standing in front
of a mammoth skyscraper.

20
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:33,118
A leviathan that rips a hole
in the clouds.

21
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:37,127
Now, what's the first question
that comes to your mind?

22
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:49,234
The first question that you ask yourself
is, ''What's on the top floor?''

23
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,175
''Who's up there in the penthouse,
and why?''

24
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,774
Now, that's who l am.

25
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,278
Are you?

26
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:05,348
Yeah, of course l am. Yes.

27
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:13,859
Bobby, opportunity knocks.

28
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:22,669
l want you to follow Hank Jennings.

29
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,376
l want you to chronicle
his existence.

30
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:30,949
Show me something
that l don't already know.

31
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,962
l'd like to see both.

32
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:52,400
Very good. Which one
would you like to see first?

33
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,197
Well...

34
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,092
What is this?

35
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,926
l'd thought l'd taken that out.

36
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,396
That property
is called Dead Dog Farm.

37
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,092
And it's worse than it sounds.

38
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,464
- What is it?
- A puzzle.

39
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:28,140
No one ever really stays there long.

40
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:30,071
When can l see it?

41
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,508
Sorry l'm late.

42
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,150
But the little nipper is so excited
about our camping trip,

43
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,752
l just couldn't coax him
out of the car.

44
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,581
Richard, this is Judy Swain

45
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,418
from the Happy Helping Hands
organization.

46
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,082
l'm little Nicky's case manager.

47
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,854
Charmed, l'm sure. Shall we?

48
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,089
Sit down.

49
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,130
Okay.

50
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,935
As l was about to tell your friends,

51
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:02,131
the number one thing
to know about Nicky

52
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:07,803
is that throughout his brief life,
he has been very confused,

53
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:13,544
and perhaps traumatized
by a persistent random misfortune.

54
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,151
Looks like he's bounced around
quite a bit.

55
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,620
Well, yes, he has.

56
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,884
- Poor child.
- Yes.

57
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,460
An orphan, you know.

58
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,029
Really? What happened?
Did his parents die?

59
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:28,560
Nicely deduced, Andrew.

60
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:31,033
Persistent random misfortune?

61
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,238
They were killed.

62
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,174
How were they killed, Miss Swain?

63
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,238
Mysterious circumstances.

64
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:42,575
l'm afraid the orphanage has never
provided us with that information.

65
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:47,214
Andy, let's go.
Emergency up at the Great Northern.

66
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,864
Looks like a heart attack.

67
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,366
Once stimulated,
the female will respond in such a way

68
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:14,172
that the skin around her...
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:17,043
Looks like Dougie went out
with his boots on.

70
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:22,078
Love Poems of Lord Byron,
The Kama Sutra,

71
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,350
Hookers and Handmaidens.

72
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:27,424
Sheriff, look at this.

73
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:35,399
What a falling out was here.

74
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,305
Doug.

75
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,513
Lord, l hate to say it, l told you so.

76
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:02,887
Here, sheriff.

77
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,388
This is it.

78
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,658
The murder weapon.

79
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,428
She might as well
have blown his brains out with a rifle.

80
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:25,115
He never could say no to a woman.

81
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,657
You old fool.

82
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:54,174
You sexual adventuress,
you'll burn in hell for this.

83
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:58,716
- Take it easy, mister.
- l'm gonna shout till l wake the dead.

84
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,217
She murdered my brother.

85
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,151
She's a witch.

86
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,292
He's right, l'm cursed.

87
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,792
Don't be silly.

88
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:13,592
No, no, it's true.

89
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:18,968
lt all started in high school,
prom night.

90
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:22,067
My date went to kiss me.

91
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,837
lt was his first day
with his new braces.

92
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,379
Oh, and they gleamed
in the moonlight.

93
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:35,086
And his rubber band snapped
and his jaw locked open,

94
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,723
and we ended up
in the emergency room,

95
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,383
and the doctors had to break his jaw
in three places to get it to shut.

96
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:46,362
And it's just gotten worse ever since.

97
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,363
A curse needs a cure.

98
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:51,094
l know a bit about these things.

99
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,637
Are you the sheriff?

100
00:09:54,874 --> 00:10:00,835
Let's just say, when something
really big goes down, l'm the man.

101
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,349
Boys, there's a story
about a great football coach,

102
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,924
whose name escapes me
at this time,

103
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:18,427
who was dead set against
having any black players on his team.

104
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:24,036
Until somebody brought him the finest
black halfback anyone had ever seen.

105
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,899
And when what's-his-name
saw him run 50 yards

106
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,700
and no one lay a hand on him,

107
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,436
he shouted, ''Look at that lndian go!''

108
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:37,447
That coach accepted
that athlete's desire to compete.

109
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,578
Nadine.

110
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,317
And today, this story applies
to this woman's--

111
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,550
This young girl's right to compete.

112
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:52,289
ln addition to it being her moral
and constitutional right.

113
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,996
Mike Nelson,
could you step up here for a second?

114
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,127
Yeah.

115
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:01,941
Come on, Mike, go.

116
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:05,402
Now, Nadine has chosen
to prove herself to us

117
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,479
by taking on our very best.

118
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:12,084
Our very own district champion,
Mike Nelson.

119
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:15,243
- Yeah! Come on. Come on.
- All right, man.

120
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,488
Go, Mike.

121
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,454
Hi, Mike.

122
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,959
Put your hand here.

123
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,653
No, here.

124
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,527
All right, now just push against me.
l'll try not to hurt you.

125
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:28,996
Wanna go out tonight?

126
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,227
This is called a tie.

127
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,341
- Oh, yeah.
- You stupid...

128
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,875
What did you say, Mike?

129
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:47,948
Neck, you're breaking my neck.

130
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,487
You're right,
this is sort of like necking.

131
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,391
What about tonight?

132
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,656
Coach?

133
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,962
Hey, coach?

134
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,871
- Get up, Mike.
- Oh, my God.

135
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:15,343
One, two and three.

136
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,983
Now will you go out with me?

137
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,400
What happened to you?

138
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,863
l got beat up by a girl.

139
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:42,272
What did you do to her?

140
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,070
Donna, l'm not kidding.
Now, you've gotta help me.

141
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,735
lt's bad enough getting stomped on
in front of the whole team,

142
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,176
but she likes me.

143
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:51,077
- Who?
- Mrs. Hurley.

144
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,950
Nadine?

145
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:55,945
lt's not funny.

146
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,613
l don't know, maybe an older woman
is just what you need.

147
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,623
l don't wanna go out with anyone
who can body-slam me.

148
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,693
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

149
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:07,458
l don't know, talk to her or something.
Pretend you're still my girlfriend.

150
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,464
Sorry, Mike,
l'm not that good of an actress.

151
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:13,366
Donna, this is serious.
l'm gonna end up in traction.

152
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,215
May l help you?

153
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,547
Hang up a local service rebellion,

154
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:33,624
wonder if you'd help me bundle up
loose sticks and burn that master.

155
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:38,389
Malcolm, Malcolm Sloan,
as in brother to Evelyn.

156
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:41,897
Mr. Marsh's driver, as in,
''Bring that car around, James.''

157
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,160
So how badly
did she damage the Jag?

158
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,632
lt's repairable.

159
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:50,103
That's the nice thing about things.

160
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,504
You know, when she and Jeffrey
fell in love,

161
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,443
he gave her a whole new life.

162
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,516
That's for sure.

163
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,922
Now l got a nice uniform,
and the keys to the liquor cabinet.

164
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,454
God, l hope
l don't sound ungrateful,

165
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,927
because compared
to the life l was living,

166
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,033
wanton dissipation is a step up.

167
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,998
And Evelyn,
she learned a lot herself.

168
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,769
Defensive postures,
masking bruises, vicious cycles.

169
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,668
What are you talking about?

170
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,038
l'm sorry, am l being obscure?

171
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:29,208
Once a fortnight,
Jeffrey pounds her mercilessly,

172
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,146
and she tries to get even
by breaking one of his things.

173
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,020
lt only perpetuates the cycle.

174
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,521
She's your sister.
Why don't you stop him?

175
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,360
Sonny boy,
nobody stops Mr. Marsh.

176
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,727
That's a golden rule around here.

177
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,300
You can jot that down
and put it under your pillow.

178
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,731
l gotta get back.

179
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:59,075
Hey, thanks.

180
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,574
l mean that.

181
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,905
Well, it's still standing.

182
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,073
Almost by force of habit.

183
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,709
Well, habit can provide
a strong foundation.

184
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,684
Dead Dog Farm, huh?

185
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:46,950
That's an old legend.
Of all the people in the world,

186
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:50,186
the best and the worst
are drawn to Dead Dog,

187
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,228
and most turn away.

188
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:55,424
Only those with the purest of heart
can feel its pain.

189
00:15:55,601 --> 00:16:00,698
And somewhere in between,
the rest of us struggle.

190
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,041
lrene, have you shown this property
to anyone else recently?

191
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,771
l don't think anyone's asked
to see it this last year.

192
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,938
There's three vehicles.

193
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:14,018
A jeep, a four-wheeler
and a luxury sedan.

194
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,517
lt's open.

195
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,257
Hello?

196
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:34,934
There's been a meeting here.
ln the past few hours.

197
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,616
What are you seeing?

198
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:55,084
They forgot
there was no running water.

199
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,063
Baby laxative.

200
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,392
More white powder.

201
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,744
Cocaine.

202
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,138
lrene, we have to notify the sheriff.

203
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:07,230
Nicky, stop that, please.

204
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,438
Nicky, stop it.

205
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,345
l don't understand this at all.

206
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,011
l just had the car checked
at Gas Farm.

207
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,585
He told me it was
in perfect working order.

208
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,450
Perfect working order.

209
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:37,419
This is all so technical.

210
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:45,461
Please, Nicky,
Uncle Dick is trying to read.

211
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,780
Nicholas, get out of the car!

212
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,277
Nicholas, out of the car, right now!

213
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,979
Out of the car!

214
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,486
Do you hear me?

215
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,720
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?

216
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,333
Well, of course l'm not mad at you.
Why should l be mad at you?

217
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:17,731
Scared you, didn't l?

218
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:45,958
Uncle Dick!

219
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't worry, don't worry,
l'm all right, little Nicky.

220
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:53,530
What if you died?
You aren't gonna die, are you?

221
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:57,334
Of course not. Don't be silly.

222
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,473
Harry?

223
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,041
Cooper. This is Colonel Riley.

224
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:09,050
He's heading up
the Air Force's investigation

225
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,654
into Briggs' disappearance.

226
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:13,053
- Colonel.
- Cooper.

227
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,989
You were with Briggs
when we lost our coordinates on him.

228
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,526
Yes, l was.

229
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:21,392
When you were at the site,
did you notice any wildlife in the area?

230
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,798
- Wildlife?
- Birds, owls?

231
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,631
Yes.

232
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:30,969
Yes, just moments before the major
disappeared, l heard an owl.

233
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,306
Any visual contact?

234
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,880
Look, colonel, Garland Briggs
is a good friend of mine.

235
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,415
lt would be a lot better
if you'd just level with us.

236
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:42,712
We know about the monitors
and the messages from deep space

237
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,856
that you received pertaining to me.

238
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,853
You may know something,
but you best get your facts straight.

239
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:52,827
Our monitors are pointed
at deep space,

240
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:57,697
but the messages we intercepted
that Briggs showed you

241
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,397
were sent from right here
in these woods.

242
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:05,737
Now, where they were sent to
is another question.

243
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:10,414
Might this have something to do
with a place called the White Lodge?

244
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,214
That's classified.

245
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,182
Colonel, we'd like to help you,

246
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,845
but you need to give us
a little more to go on here.

247
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:25,088
Garland Briggs is the best pilot
l've ever known.

248
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:29,394
He was born with hardware
most of us only dream about.

249
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,732
l can tell you this:

250
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:38,804
His disappearance has implications
that go so far beyond national security

251
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:42,345
the Cold War seems like a case
of the sniffles.

252
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:55,624
The engine's fine,
the axle should be okay.

253
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,754
How did you get so good at this?

254
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,066
Oh, my uncle Ed.

255
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:03,791
You think l'm good,
you should see him.

256
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,561
He can fix anything.

257
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:11,575
l was talking to your brother today
a little bit about your situation.

258
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,577
Look, James,
mind your own business.

259
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,316
Are you afraid?

260
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:20,878
Are you afraid of your husband?

261
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,582
Are you?

262
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,683
There's nothing to talk about.

263
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,494
l know what it's like to be alone.

264
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,411
You are afraid of him, aren't you?

265
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:54,617
Why don't you just leave?

266
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,515
lt's complicated.

267
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,961
Oh, my God, it's him.

268
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,530
l've gotta go.

269
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,135
lt's not as bad as l made it out to be.

270
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:52,539
Oh, look who's here.
Did Daddy have a change of heart?

271
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:55,737
Daddy just made the smartest decision
that he's made all year.

272
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:59,543
Oh, yeah? That's not saying much.
What did he do?

273
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,216
He put me on the payroll.

274
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:05,356
Bobby, you junior achiever, you.

275
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,855
And this right here?

276
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,926
This is my first assignment.

277
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,023
Anything l can help you with?

278
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:14,631
Maybe.

279
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,204
Maybe you can help me celebrate

280
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,397
after l show this to the boss.

281
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,304
Well, you know what l think,
Bobby Briggs?

282
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:27,211
Tell.

283
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,076
l think that we should think

284
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,710
about doing business together.

285
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,421
Audrey, l like the way you think.

286
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,120
Thank you.

287
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,420
Hey, Mr. Horne, how's it going?

288
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:19,060
What is this
you're doing here, exactly?

289
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:22,695
Gettysburg, day one.

290
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:25,133
The South is winning.

291
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:30,133
l followed Hank,
got those pictures you wanted.

292
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:43,147
You see, l don't know what he's up to,
but l'm sure it's no good.

293
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:44,983
l mean, l've never seen
these guys before,

294
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:48,217
but they're not exactly from the Rotary,
if you know what l mean.

295
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,157
- l like you, Bobby.
- Oh, l like you too.

296
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:53,855
How much am l paying you?

297
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,864
We haven't actually
discussed money.

298
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,733
Well, you can consider this
your first raise.

299
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:06,708
Now, you come back tomorrow,
and we will discuss a full-time position.

300
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:13,177
Thank you, Ben.
l won't let you down.

301
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:30,390
Nectar of the gods, my dear.

302
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,764
lt's the bubbles.

303
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:44,740
Wine comes in at the mouth.

304
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:49,017
Love comes in at the eye.

305
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:56,050
I touch my gIass to my Iips,
I Iook at you and sigh.

306
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:58,352
Thank you, Pete.

307
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,463
That's very lyrical.

308
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,725
lt's Yeats.

309
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,699
He's a poet.

310
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:09,571
Yes, l know.

311
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:13,233
The only other toast l know
is a limerick.

312
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,413
No, really. Really, Pete, that was--

313
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,415
- There once was a Iady from GaIway--
- Josie!

314
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,949
- Yes.
- We'll have our appetizers now.

315
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,626
- Yes.
- Oh, Josie.

316
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:33,128
l just want you to know

317
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,291
that even though your station
in this household has changed,

318
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:42,099
l intend to show you all the respect
and affection that you deserve.

319
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:49,076
Thank you, Catherine.
And l will try to do the same.

320
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,273
Oh, and put on your little maid's cap.

321
00:27:57,155 --> 00:28:01,649
Catherine, don't you think maybe
you're being a little hard on her?

322
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:04,853
l mean, she is still part of the family.

323
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,628
Josie had a hand in Andrew's death,

324
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,599
and she did everything in her power
to destroy me.

325
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,170
She is lucky she's not hanging
from a tree.

326
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
l don't believe it.

327
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,972
Not the Josie l know.

328
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:26,846
l would like to propose a toast
to Ben Horne's double-cross.

329
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:30,045
Here's to Josie Packard's
dirty deeds.

330
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:34,385
And here's to the woman
who brought them down.

331
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,125
Here's to me.

332
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,764
Here's to you, poodle.

333
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,634
Diane, l'm holding in my hand
a nationally distributed newspaper.

334
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,369
My opening move, responding
to Windom Earle's opening move,

335
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,877
was printed in the personal columns
per my instructions.

336
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:02,544
But l've already received
his response to this yesterday.

337
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:06,885
He anticipated my response
to his opening move perfectly.

338
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:10,194
He's toying with me, Diane.

339
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,694
l wonder where he is
and what he's planning.

340
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:20,328
Meanwhile,
l've spent the past two days

341
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:23,030
without badge and gun
the best way l know how:

342
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,234
Occupying both body and spirit.

343
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:27,935
Looked into some real estate,

344
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:32,049
what the local agent
charitably refers to as a fixer-upper.

345
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,447
Nonetheless, it's a place
where a man might make a home,

346
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,883
raise a family, which is something,
in spite of my past,

347
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:39,023
l still hope l'm able to do.

348
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:43,193
However, as is the case here
in Twin Peaks,

349
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,956
even this bucolic hideaway
is filled with secrets.

350
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:50,761
Secrets that may be connected
to my trouble at the Bureau

351
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:54,235
and the cocaine that was found
in my automobile.

352
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,943
Agent Hardy's deliberations
will soon be completed.

353
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,102
And if l'm not adequately able
to defend myself,

354
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,407
there's a very real possibility
of imprisonment.

355
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:22,794
- Hello, Agent Cooper.
- Audrey.

356
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,103
This is for you. l stole it.

357
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:35,507
Don't you think
you'd better give it back?

358
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,910
Not until you look at what's inside.

359
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:41,247
Okay.

360
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:43,978
What am l gonna find
in here, Audrey?

361
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,953
Pictures my father paid for.

362
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,967
l did good, didn't l?

363
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:00,528
Audrey, you did better than good.

364
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,036
You may have saved my life.

365
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,170
Good.

366
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,114
So that makes us even now, right?

367
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:20,347
- Denise.
- Hi, Coop.

368
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,018
Come in.

369
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,792
Sorry, am l interrupting something?

370
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,662
Special Agent Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

371
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,734
This is a very good friend of mine,
Audrey Horne.

372
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,899
They have women agents?

373
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,201
More or less.

374
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,678
Audrey, if you'll excuse us.
Agency business.

375
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,542
l thought you were suspended.

376
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,015
l am.

377
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:50,177
Thanks again. Good night.

378
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:56,491
Thank you. You're welcome.

379
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,771
These are photographs
of an abandoned property

380
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,838
on the outskirts of town.

381
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,170
Jean Renault, Hank Jennings,

382
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:16,371
Norma Jennings' stepfather,
Sergeant King, mounted police.

383
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,845
They were at the scene
earlier today.

384
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:23,784
ln the kitchen l found traces of cocaine
and the baby laxative used to step it up.

385
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:26,622
l think if you compare this,
which was taken from the farm,

386
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,624
with the stuff found in my automobile,
you'll find it to be a match.

387
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,853
- That's good news, Coop.
- Yeah.

388
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,726
Now, can we talk about something
more important?

389
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,766
Exactly how old is that girl?

390
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,533
Denise, l would assume
you're no longer interested in girls.

391
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:44,698
Coop, l may be wearing a dress,

392
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:48,812
but l still pull my panties on one leg
at a time, if you know what l mean.

393
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,777
Not really.

394
00:32:56,755 --> 00:33:00,657
You gonna eat that pie
or just push it around on my china?

395
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,419
l guess l ain't all that hungry.

396
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:04,994
Wanna talk about it?

397
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,256
Oh, you don't wanna hear
my problems.

398
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,964
We used to talk about everything.

399
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,667
We can still talk, Ed.

400
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:19,434
Remember when we were kids,
all those plans we made?

401
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:23,069
lt was like we were just waiting around
for our lives to begin,

402
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:26,580
planning all that stuff we'd do
when we did.

403
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,317
Somehow, life starts
before you know it.

404
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,082
Suddenly, you're halfway through
living it, and all those plans,

405
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:35,453
they just don't mean a damn thing.

406
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,824
This is my life, Norma.
l just don't like it much.

407
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,072
We can make new plans.

408
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,820
Andrew.

409
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:10,991
What is it, Dick?

410
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,130
May l have a word with you?

411
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,289
Sure.

412
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:18,732
- l feel we may have a problem.
- What problem?

413
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:20,700
lt's our mutual friend, little Nicky.

414
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,841
- Yes?
- How shall l put this?

415
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:27,011
Well, he's, he's...

416
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:30,909
Andy, l believe that little Nicky,
incredible as it may seem,

417
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,912
may in fact be the devil.

418
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,745
Devil?

419
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:38,720
Or at the very least,
homicidal in the first degree.

420
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,122
Andy, we've got to find out
what happened to his parents.

421
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:51,063
l've got the autopsy report.

422
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:55,672
Dwayne, Dougie died
of natural causes. Heart attack.

423
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,434
No evidence of foul play.

424
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,046
Did you check him for witchcraft?

425
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:08,918
That's not the kind of thing
that shows up in an autopsy.

426
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,521
l wanna press charges.

427
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,454
Now, Dwayne, you know
l can't press charges

428
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,888
if there hasn't been a crime.

429
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:20,360
Well, she killed him with sex.

430
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:24,628
And how much clearer
does it have to be?

431
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,294
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day.

432
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:31,272
Why don't you just go home
and try and get some rest.

433
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,910
You want me to go to sleep.

434
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:39,812
Not until that murdering hussy
is behind bars, where she belongs.

435
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,782
l'll sue her, l'll file civil suits.

436
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:47,321
She'll not get her hands
on any of Dougie's money

437
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:49,084
as long as l have a breath.

438
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,095
Not one single red cent. Nothing.

439
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,932
l'll... l'll...

440
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:03,604
Harry, do you still have
that bottle of lrish in your office?

441
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:07,302
l wanna put some in a little warm milk
for the widow Milford.

442
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:13,780
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

443
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:17,113
lt seems she hangs
against the cheek of night

444
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:21,122
like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.

445
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:27,925
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

446
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,529
Twin Peaks Sheriff Station,
this is Lucy speaking.

447
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:05,193
One moment, please.

448
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,630
Sheriff Truman?

449
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,502
Sheriff?

450
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,376
Sheriff Truman.

451
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:25,990
Sheriff Truman,
you have a teIephone caII, Iine three.

452
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:33,025
One moment, please.

453
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:00,855
So wait, it gets better.
And then l said:

454
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:04,859
''Well, what do you think
underpants are for, anyway?''

455
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:08,260
Tell us another one.
Please, another. One more.

456
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,296
This one time, l had this cousin.

457
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:13,937
He was a clown
in this rodeo, you know.

458
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:19,099
They just had all these
really big horses, you know.

459
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:22,371
And you will not believe
what they made him do.

460
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:23,775
- What?
- What?

461
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,609
They made him-- Thank you.

462
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:27,910
- They made him stand in the middle,
- Yeah.

463
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:32,250
and take his clown costume
completely off.

464
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:02,152
Can l help you?

465
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,987
Mr. Niles, l don't wanna put
the squeeze on you.

466
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:07,852
You've been to prison,

467
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,927
l don't need to paint you
any pictures.

468
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,528
What's this all about?

469
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,329
For starters, you're guilty
of a serious parole violation.

470
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,007
Enough to put you back inside.

471
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,135
And unless you cooperate,

472
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:32,681
l intend to do everything in my power
to make sure you stay there.

473
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,514
My name is Ernie Niles,
and l confess.

474
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:37,950
l'm guilty.

475
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:41,523
l guess l'm terribly guilty,
against my will, of course.

476
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,718
Mr. Niles, we're not really interested
in all the--

477
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:45,452
They held me at gunpoint,
they beat me,

478
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,291
they threatened me
with physical violence.

479
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:49,330
These men are animals,
they'll stop at nothing.

480
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,524
Mr. Niles, just--

481
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,192
They wanted me
to sell drugs for them.

482
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,170
l tried to resist,
but my family means everything to me.

483
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,902
My family... When they threatened
my wife, well, l weakened, you know.

484
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,876
l'm terribly, terribly sorry.

485
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:06,346
l guess l did wrong but, you know,

486
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:10,180
love makes a guy do foolish things,
you know, illegal things--

487
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:12,345
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, will you shut up?

488
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:14,753
Mr. Niles, we appreciate the trials
you've been through,

489
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,187
we sympathize with you.

490
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,987
- You do?
- That's why we're here.

491
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:20,153
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

492
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,196
Now tell us everything you know.

493
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,857
Yes, this is-- Well, they tortured me,

494
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,368
and the thing was,
they did filthy, horrible--

495
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:28,869
Mr. Niles, please.

496
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,237
Just the information pertaining
to the selling of drugs, if you please.

497
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,707
All right, yeah.

498
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:40,215
Yeah. Well, they got four kilos
of cocaine to sell so--

499
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:41,612
And they're looking for buyers.

500
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:45,688
So to protect my family,
l told them l could find one.

501
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,085
Have you?

502
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:50,386
Are you kidding? l don't know anybody
who would do anything like that.

503
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,426
You do now.

504
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:56,589
A major drug trafficker
will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.

505
00:40:56,768 --> 00:41:00,431
You will set up a meet with these men
at the Dead Dog Farm.

506
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,072
l will?

507
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:06,743
How will l--?
How will l know him?

508
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:10,071
You're looking at him.

509
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,739
Him? Him...

510
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:18,014
Will you excuse me?
l've got a nervous bladder.

511
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:25,156
Why?!
Why?! Why would you...?

512
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,731
You could have...

513
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,812
ls she gonna be okay?

514
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,321
First time he beat her,
l swore revenge.

515
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,323
Something violent and noble.

516
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,852
She begged me not to hurt him,
made me promise,

517
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,428
said it was for both our sakes.

518
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:04,266
That was four years ago.

519
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,634
One day, l swear, l'll kill him.

520
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:12,067
No matter what it costs.

521
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,496
Jeez, Mom,
give me a heart attack.

522
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,194
l'm sorry.

523
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:44,841
What are you doing here
sitting alone in the dark?

524
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,403
Nothing. Just sitting here.

525
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:54,483
Well, read a book or something,
will you? lt's creepy.

526
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,390
lt's Dad, right?

527
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:06,621
He'll be back, you know he will.

528
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:09,356
This is just some of that
top-secret jazz.

529
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:12,634
l'm not so sure this time.

530
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:21,167
l was at the Double R
a couple of weeks ago.

531
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:26,081
Dad and l, we had this talk

532
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,583
about this dream he had.

533
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:35,659
lt was a big house in white marble,
lots of lights.

534
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:40,356
Dad was there, and l was there too,

535
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:44,759
living a life of deep harmony and joy.

536
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:49,202
And there was all this stuff
about my future.

537
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,866
Good stuff.

538
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:57,779
Kind of nice. Mom, it was cool.

539
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:01,749
Your father
is an extraordinary human being.

540
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:06,816
My father
is a deeply weird individual.

541
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:11,087
But he has a lot more going on
under his hat than most people,

542
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:13,127
that's for sure.

543
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:16,960
Sometimes when l'm sleeping

544
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:20,399
he runs his fingers through my hair.

545
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:24,803
He thinks l don't notice, but l do.

546
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,444
How long have l been gone?

547
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:41,925
- Two days.
- Strange.

548
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,858
lt seemed much shorter.

549
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:48,856
Garland!

550
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:56,997
Bobby, l want you
to put out that cigarette.

551
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:05,772
Then l'd like you to fix me a cocktail.

552
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,350
A strong one, if you don't mind.

553
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,282
Sure, Dad.

554
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:19,795
ls everything all right?

555
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:22,396
No, dear.

556
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:24,958
Not exactly.
