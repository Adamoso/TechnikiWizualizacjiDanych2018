1
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:52,513
Hold it. Watch it, watch it.

2
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,857
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

3
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,088
- Got it. Got it.
- Thank you.

4
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:01,294
On your shoulder,
put it on your shoulder.

5
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,561
- Watch the step.
- Watch the step.

6
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,638
Easy, easy.

7
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,740
lf you need some help down there,
say something.

8
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,739
- Watch it.
- Keep it coming.

9
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,105
- Don't go too fast.
- Easy.

10
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,746
That's it, come on.

11
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,283
You hit me in the foot.

12
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,213
Watch the car.

13
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,382
- The car's right here.
- That's it.

14
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,298
Watch where you step.

15
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:39,330
Oh, man.

16
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:41,269
Rusty?

17
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,966
What was Rusty's last name?

18
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,110
Tomasky.

19
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,517
He got me in with the band.
l'm a roadie.

20
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:54,243
What were you doing
in Twin Peaks?

21
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,953
We were supposed to play a gig
in Knife River,

22
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:00,422
but a tire on the van crapped out.

23
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:02,625
Then you met someone.

24
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,856
Yeah, this guy--
This guy came out of the woods,

25
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,330
like Bigfoot or something,

26
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:12,233
and he's wearing a weird suit.

27
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,963
And we talked to him for a while

28
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,510
and he said he had some brew,
you know, would we like some.

29
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,477
So Rusty went with him.

30
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,173
l didn't see him after that.

31
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,953
We'll need to get in touch
with Rusty's parents.

32
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,652
He hated his parents.

33
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,459
He's staying with his uncle
in Moses Lake until we were gonna--

34
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,568
We were gonna move.

35
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,169
We were gonna move to L.A.

36
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,374
Andy.

37
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:00,275
My foot! Watch it.

38
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,319
He's taken another pawn, Harry,

39
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,586
but he didn't tell us his move.

40
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,592
Windom Earle's
playing off the board.

41
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,033
- Morning, Lucy.
- Morning, Sheriff Truman.

42
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:21,605
- Morning, Lucy.
- Agent Cooper.

43
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:24,003
Deputy Hawk is in your office,
sheriff.

44
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,871
He's with somebody
l've never seen before,

45
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:29,880
but he looks really sad,
so Hawk is feeding him breakfast.

46
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,916
Andy.

47
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,349
Yes, Lucy?

48
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,621
What do you know
about saving our planet?

49
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,694
l know it's in a lot of trouble.

50
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,858
Andy, l'm taking fate
into my own hands.

51
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,597
Mostly because the suspense
is too much for me.

52
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:57,368
Tomorrow is D-day. Dad Day.

53
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:03,144
ln 24 hours,
l will choose the father of my child.

54
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,045
Deputy Andy Brennan

55
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:09,555
or clothing salesman
Richard Tremayne.

56
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,951
What does that have to do
with the Miss Twin Peaks contest?

57
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:20,121
l-- l mean, we could use
the money.

58
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,131
We could also use a father.

59
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,161
So l have to make a speech
about saving our planet,

60
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:27,897
which is a great concept,

61
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:31,601
but l have no idea
how to go about it.

62
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,075
Yet.

63
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,613
l do know that people have got to stop
sinking their beer cans in Pearl Lake

64
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,876
when they're fishing.

65
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:41,483
Beer cans.

66
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:46,990
And Styrofoam never dies
for as long as you live.

67
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,688
lt doesn't?

68
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,274
- Randy, has Audrey returned?
- No, sir.

69
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,541
- No messages from her?
- No, sir.

70
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,718
Would you send someone up
for my bags, please?

71
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,477
Certainly.

72
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,228
The insurance companies
send me so many forms

73
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,561
that l could get a heart attack
just lifting them.

74
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,164
You're fine.

75
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:37,237
lt's what's in your heart
you should be worried about.

76
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,974
l know that l have given you
reason to doubt me.

77
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,749
But l am only interested in doing
the right thing for everybody.

78
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,752
Then stay away from Eileen.

79
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,753
l can't.

80
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,156
Not as long as the lie survives.

81
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,763
Damn it, Ben. lt's not that simple.

82
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,398
l believe you.

83
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:06,036
l applaud your desire
to do the right thing.

84
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:10,233
But goodness in you is--
lt's like a time bomb.

85
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:15,604
There's nothing good
about ruined lives.

86
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:19,513
lt is a confusing
and difficult process.

87
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:22,548
But l must continue.

88
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:26,115
Sorry, Will.

89
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,294
Excuse me.

90
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,931
- Jack, come on in.
- Hi.

91
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,632
You know Will Hayward?

92
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:39,966
Yes, hello. l've met your daughter.
She's a lovely girl.

93
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,372
Yeah, should be getting back
to my office.

94
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:49,147
Nice to see you again, John.

95
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:56,248
Ben, be careful, please.

96
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,095
l've been looking for Audrey.

97
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,422
She should be back any minute.

98
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,797
Ben, l gotta go.

99
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,492
They're gassing up the jet
as we speak.

100
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,003
Well, you can call her
when you get to wherever it is

101
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:16,540
you are in such a hurry to get to.

102
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,844
A friend of mine--

103
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:22,176
He was more than a friend, he was
a partner. --he's been murdered.

104
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,567
Female child.

105
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:48,299
Mother, Eileen Hayward.

106
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,676
Daughter, Donna Marie.

107
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,510
Father...

108
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:12,621
Donna? Donna, where are you?

109
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,826
- What is it, Mom?
- Deputy Hawk is on the phone.

110
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,368
l'll be right there.

111
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,904
He says it's important.

112
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:38,419
- Ms. Horne, l have several messages.
- Great.

113
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,320
l'll take that for you.

114
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,553
Okay. Thanks.

115
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,027
Audrey.

116
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:48,531
Agent Cooper would like to see you
at the sheriff's station.

117
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,602
Oh, well, l have a lot of work to do.
Maybe this afternoon.

118
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,331
Now. lt's important.

119
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,738
Okay.

120
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,775
But what about Stop Ghostwood?

121
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,439
How am l supposed
to get ahold of you?

122
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,516
l need more time.

123
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:09,086
A brave man is dead.

124
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:12,880
He's my friend,
and l have to take his place.

125
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,856
You aren't coming back, are you?

126
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,023
Damn this rainforest business
anyway.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,758
You can handle this without me.

128
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,769
l don't know.
l'm afraid that l'm weak.

129
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,937
Ben Horne, weak?
l find that hard to believe.

130
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,804
Strive for goodness, huh?

131
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,539
Tell the hardest truth first.

132
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,410
Just do the best you can.

133
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,175
That's all you really can do.

134
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,886
Well, l'm sorry
that Audrey wasn't here.

135
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,262
l want you to give her
something for me.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,729
Tell her l--

137
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:58,793
Just give it to her, will you?

138
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,933
Good luck.

139
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:08,007
See if any of these symbols
have to do with

140
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,182
harvest schedules
or ancient calendars.

141
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,977
Look for any curious nomenclature.

142
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,846
Got it, chief.

143
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,322
Good work, Cappy.

144
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,686
- Major. How goes the battle?
- Harry.

145
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,828
- Agent Cooper.
- Major, you look bushed.

146
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,958
Well, l spent the night obtaining and
perusing the Project Blue Book files

147
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,623
regarding Windom Earle.

148
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,735
l found it impossible to sleep after.

149
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,529
What have you gleaned?

150
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,606
Earle was the best
and brightest among us.

151
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,766
But when our attention
turned from outer space

152
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,003
to the wooded areas
surrounding Twin Peaks,

153
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,170
he became destructively obsessive.

154
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,776
Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner.

155
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,615
Possessive of his assignments,
finally violent.

156
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,883
He was removed from the project.

157
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,460
l found this in the project archives.

158
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,865
These-- These evil sorcerers,
dugpas, they're called,

159
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,630
they cultivate evil for the sake of evil,
nothing else.

160
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:10,174
They express themselves
in darkness for darkness

161
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,970
without leavening motive.

162
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:17,541
Now, this-- This ardent purity
allows them to access a secret place

163
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:21,050
where the cultivation of evil proceeds
in exponential fashion,

164
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,554
and with it, the furtherance
of evil's resulting power.

165
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:30,695
This place of power is tangible
and as such, it can be found, entered

166
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:33,491
and perhaps utilized
in some fashion.

167
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,226
The dugpas have many names
for it,

168
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:41,567
but chief among them is the--
ls the Black Lodge.

169
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,668
You don't believe me, do you?
You think l'm mad.

170
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,835
Overworked.

171
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,079
Go away.

172
00:12:56,255 --> 00:13:00,021
Gentlemen, when Windom Earle
arrived in Twin Peaks,

173
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,627
l assumed
he had come for vengeance.

174
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,262
For me.

175
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,091
But l miscalculated.

176
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,692
He has insinuated himself
into the lives of people l care for.

177
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,395
He has murdered innocents.

178
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:15,973
He has engaged us in subterfuge
and red herring.

179
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,837
A fish l don't particularly care for.

180
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,902
But all of these acts
are merely camouflage.

181
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,947
He's been after something else
all along:

182
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:26,585
The Black Lodge.

183
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,423
Fellas, we need to find out what this,
the Black Lodge, has to do with that.

184
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,289
Do you really believe
there's a connection?

185
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,232
Windom Earle does, Harry.

186
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:52,733
All right. Harry, we're gonna go
through these files from top to bottom.

187
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:56,473
Cappy, l want you to dig up
everything you can about the dugpas.

188
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,243
Major,
l think you'd better hit the sack.

189
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,318
l could use a good stretch.

190
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,318
Perhaps a walk in the woods
to clear my mind.

191
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,423
Good idea.
Don't forget the bread crumbs.

192
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:06,819
Right.

193
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:12,328
Harry, let's do it.

194
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:18,367
You know, Leo, the only thing
that Columbus discovered

195
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:20,972
was that he was lost.

196
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:25,438
Cooper and the gang
haven't even left the snide yet.

197
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,203
l know something they don't know.

198
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,010
l know something young Dale
merely suspects.

199
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:34,948
Project Blue Book.

200
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,215
Little men,
pewits loaded with optimism.

201
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:42,224
They were a deterrent so slight
it was practically encouragement.

202
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:46,228
Yet l would like to ask Major Briggs
a question or three.

203
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:50,960
Polish up that bald nub of his
and see what shines.

204
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:59,745
Perhaps, Leo, we too
should venture out for a good stretch.

205
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,006
Wouldn't it be fun to have
a Project Blue Book reunion?

206
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,309
Wine, cheese, talk about old times,

207
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:08,976
trade hilarious anecdotes
of the good old days.

208
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:13,453
l wonder what amongst my detritus
l can use to spice up Briggs' life.

209
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,327
Leo, stop dawdling.

210
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:19,726
lf you were outside,
you'd have trouble with pigeons.

211
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,502
''And that's the only way
we're ever going to save the trees.

212
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,945
lt's time to stand up and kick some butt
for our environment.

213
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,018
Before it's too late for all of us.''

214
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,186
lt's beautiful, letter-perfect.

215
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:49,688
l don't know about
the ''kick butt'' part.

216
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,093
How about ''fight''?

217
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,064
lt's time to stand up
and fight for our environment.

218
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,066
Much better.

219
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,433
Shelly, l've been thinking.

220
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,873
Oh, Bobby, l know, l know, l know.

221
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:07,570
- The speech counts double--
- Forget about the contest.

222
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,271
l've been thinking about us.

223
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,546
You have?

224
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:18,553
l know that l have not been paying
the right kind of attention to you lately.

225
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:22,225
l got busy with Mr. Horne.

226
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,462
l started wearing suits, okay,
and suddenly l'm walking around

227
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,929
like l'm more important
than everybody else.

228
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,766
You were pretty crummy.

229
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:38,974
Bobby, l've missed you.

230
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:43,111
l've missed all the things
we used to do together.

231
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:50,611
When l saw you kissing
that guy...something snapped.

232
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:54,281
lt was like my brain rolled over,

233
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,329
and l could see all the stuff
that was special to me.

234
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,664
All the stuff that matters.

235
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,164
l love you, Shelly.

236
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,036
And l wanna spend my time
with that.

237
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,042
l mean, you know,
if that's okay with you,

238
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:16,079
l'd like to do that, you know...

239
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:22,010
Bobby, what do you think?

240
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,188
Lucky.

241
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,595
Lucky me.

242
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,831
Shelly, telephone.

243
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:41,495
Agent Cooper's on the line.
He needs to talk to you.

244
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:45,007
Now, Shelly, he says it's important.

245
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:07,563
- l've got great news.
- What?

246
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:12,600
lt's going to be Norma Jennings
and Richard Tremayne.

247
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,866
Tremayne is the third judge.
lt's in the bag.

248
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,202
Well, now, l have to be sure.

249
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,277
Baby, l have to be sure
l'm gonna win.

250
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:26,407
Oh, my God, this guy's British
or Bahamian or something.

251
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,746
He's bound to fall for your charms.

252
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:34,882
We'll find some way
to get you two together, alone.

253
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,029
And then,
you put on a dress with a slit.

254
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:42,258
Oh, the slit cut halfway
up to Seattle.

255
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:47,804
And then, nestle in real close to him

256
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:51,465
and when he gets a look
at those gams

257
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:57,980
and smells that French perfume
dripping off you and then...

258
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:05,280
...becomes lost
in those brown eyes...

259
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,458
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

260
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,620
Stop it, you vixen, you.

261
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,891
l can't stand it anymore.

262
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,160
Why can't we just elope and...

263
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:21,500
No. Now, not until l've won, darling.

264
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:25,768
Then, and only then,
l will marry you.

265
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,907
Oh, you're so strict, darling.

266
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,847
And l am the blasted mayor.

267
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,953
Oh, now, baby, come here.

268
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:38,753
lt's okay.

269
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:39,948
lt's okay.

270
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,196
Each of you received
a piece of this poem.

271
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,629
Each in a curious manner,
along with this invitation.

272
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,964
We all went to the Roadhouse,
nobody showed up.

273
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:56,463
Have any of you had contact recently
with a stranger?

274
00:19:56,642 --> 00:20:02,547
Someone who struck you as peculiar,
personable or just plain puzzling?

275
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:07,284
Well, there was this strange guy who
said he was a friend of my father's.

276
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,655
Same day l got the poem,
l got a $1 0 tip for a cup of coffee.

277
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,950
That's unusual.

278
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,284
You know, there was a funny old guy
at the library.

279
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:17,554
He asked me
to read the poem to him.

280
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,754
All three.

281
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,524
Shelly, take a closer look.

282
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,169
Does this handwriting
look familiar to you?

283
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,206
lt's Leo's.

284
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,642
Listen carefully.

285
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:38,374
l want each of you to check in
with the sheriff twice a day.

286
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:42,043
Nine o'clock in the morning,
9:00 at night.

287
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:46,021
l want your parents
to know your whereabouts at all times.

288
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,690
You walk to school,
you drive to work,

289
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:52,922
make sure
that you do not do so alone.

290
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,596
Please believe me
when l tell you to be very careful.

291
00:20:57,803 --> 00:20:59,896
You're in danger.

292
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,938
We all are.

293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,188
You would've appreciated
the dugpas, Leo.

294
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:21,087
Ancient sorcerers bent on evil.

295
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,956
Rather like the Kali worshippers
in lndia.

296
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,359
Another fine bunch of zanies,
l can tell you.

297
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:29,763
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch.

298
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,038
Those were the good old days.

299
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:39,343
- Shelly.
- Very good, Leo, you remember.

300
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,778
Tawdry little trollop.

301
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,278
Shelly.

302
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,474
Just between you and me, old boy,

303
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:49,917
your wife has some
fairly modern views on marital fidelity.

304
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,818
But no matter.

305
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:54,118
She is still fit for a queen.

306
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,496
Would you mourn her passing, Leo?
l doubt it.

307
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,959
Her death, Leo.

308
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:07,162
Shelly's imminent demise.

309
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,068
lt's very simple, really.

310
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,369
Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks,
Shelly dies.

311
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,273
Maybe you'd like to help.

312
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,414
Shelly. No.

313
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,409
Good God, what have you got there?

314
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,920
No, Leo, l'm begging you.

315
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:29,458
- l prithee. Have mercy, Leo.
- Love Shelly.

316
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,485
Poor Leo.

317
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,548
We are all love's fools, more or less.

318
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,056
But you will learn, as l have,

319
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:04,161
the value of hate.

320
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,522
Hi.

321
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,820
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, Audrey.

322
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:37,162
- Welcome home, honey.
- Thanks.

323
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,889
l got back this morning but
Agent Cooper needed to see me, so...

324
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,327
Something's wrong?

325
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,900
Some creep sent me a poem.

326
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,060
l tried to call Jack's room,
but he wasn't there.

327
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:50,607
- Do you know where he is?
- Audrey, while you were gone,

328
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:55,244
- l had the most incredible brainstorm.
- What?

329
00:23:55,514 --> 00:24:00,178
The Stop Ghostwood movement
needs a spokesperson.

330
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:03,754
Someone with a highly visible profile

331
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,380
to be able to inspire
our community to action.

332
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,194
Daddy, where's Jack?

333
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,489
You can do it, Audrey.

334
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,064
As Miss Twin Peaks,

335
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:20,103
you could be that spokesperson
and you could use your public platform

336
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,435
- No, Dad.
- as a forum for environmental debate.

337
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,769
Audrey, listen, you can do it.

338
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:28,777
Only you can take our message
to the people.

339
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:34,577
Daddy,
where is John Justice Wheeler?

340
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,952
- He's gone.
- Where did he go?

341
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:47,627
Some tragedy in Brazil
demanded his immediate attention.

342
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,398
He left a letter for you,
l have it here.

343
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:54,129
Daddy.

344
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:59,911
- When did he leave?
- A few minutes ago to the airport.

345
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,613
Audrey,
what about Miss Twin Peaks?

346
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,976
l'll talk with you about this later,
okay? l promise.

347
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,313
Audrey. Audrey. Audrey?

348
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:15,424
Josie, l see your face.

349
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:18,358
- Randy.
- Yes.

350
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,355
Oh, forget it. You.

351
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,966
Do you have a car?

352
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:25,296
A truck. Runs like a dream.

353
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,438
Great, let's go.

354
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,869
Wait. Oh, l'm sorry.

355
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:34,341
Come on. Come on.

356
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:40,644
Well, the symbols suggest a time.

357
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,949
Seems clear.

358
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:46,454
- A time for what?
- l don't know.

359
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,719
At first l thought it was a signpost.
Perhaps it's an invitation.

360
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,624
Or both.

361
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:55,196
Where's the major?

362
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,463
He should be here by now.

363
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:01,970
Andy, give Mrs. Briggs a call,
see if the major's home yet.

364
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,180
What is it, Coop?

365
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:18,054
Oh, just thinking
about Annie Blackburn.

366
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,626
Well, bless your heart,
l've never known your mind to wander.

367
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,854
Oh, Harry,
l've been feeling this way all day.

368
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:31,027
You know, l proceed as usual,
my mind clear and focused

369
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,502
and suddenly, out of nowhere,
l see her face and l hear her voice.

370
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:41,876
Naturally, l try to reorient myself,
come back to the task at hand,

371
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,278
but the image remains.

372
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,643
Sometimes l actually feel dizzy.

373
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:51,018
A man in love
is supposed to feel that way.

374
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:54,215
Well, my symptoms suggest
the onset of malaria.

375
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,861
But l've never felt better in my life.

376
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,796
l'm sorry, Harry, that sounds foolish.

377
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:04,959
No, no, man, it sounds lucky.

378
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:47,610
Home, home on the range

379
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,613
Where the deer
And the antelope play

380
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:56,686
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word

381
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:59,153
Hello, Wilbur.

382
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:12,426
And the skies are not cloudy all day

383
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:20,506
Long time no see, Briggsy.

384
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,316
Leo.

385
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:29,852
lt looks like
you've finally found your calling.

386
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:56,043
Couldn't hurt to give it a shot.

387
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:58,307
Maybe next year.

388
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,848
Annie, there's a whole world out there.
Jump in.

389
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,682
''Hear the other side.
See the other side.''

390
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,221
St. Augustine.

391
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,723
- Coffee?
- You bet.

392
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:26,269
- Something's troubling you.
- Yes.

393
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:28,504
Would you like to talk about it?

394
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:33,749
Annie, l'm involved
in a fairly complicated investigation

395
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,910
requiring my complete attention.

396
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:39,114
Yet l spend most of my time
thinking of you.

397
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,590
l know the feeling.

398
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,628
l've been seeing your face
in fried eggs all this morning.

399
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,232
You know, there are those who believe
in a scientific basis for attraction.

400
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:52,870
lt's chemical.

401
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:54,938
ls that what it is?

402
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,968
l don't know.

403
00:29:57,142 --> 00:30:00,908
Hard to comprehend
without perspective.

404
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,774
Yeah.

405
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:06,246
l spent five years
trying to comprehend it.

406
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,710
Hey.

407
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:11,355
lt's hard for me.

408
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:15,424
But l have faith in you,
in us, because l understand it.

409
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:17,391
We're very much alike.

410
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:18,995
lt helps.

411
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,462
We think too much.

412
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,500
''What we observe
is not nature itself,

413
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:28,366
but nature exposed
to our method of questioning.''

414
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:31,642
Heisenberg.

415
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,975
Maybe we should go bowling.

416
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,975
How about dancing?

417
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,585
l don't know how.

418
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,482
l'll teach you. lt's easy.

419
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:47,113
- When?
- Tonight.

420
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,221
There he is, step on it.

421
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:29,161
Jack! Jack, stop!

422
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:40,734
l guess a simple goodbye
was out of the question.

423
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,688
l love you.

424
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,224
l love you too.

425
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:02,090
- Do you have to leave?
- Yes.

426
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,000
When will you be back?

427
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,731
l don't know.

428
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,472
l'm a virgin.

429
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,066
What?

430
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,609
l want you to make love with me.

431
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,674
What? Here and now?

432
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,686
lt's your jet.

433
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:25,849
Thank God for that.

434
00:32:56,254 --> 00:33:00,782
When did you first see
the symbol in Owl Cave?

435
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:04,622
l'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

436
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,557
Cheater.

437
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:16,163
What does the cave painting mean?

438
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:21,408
l'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

439
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:26,278
Damn, but l love the military mind.

440
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,652
What is the capital
of North Carolina?

441
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:39,820
Raleigh.

442
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:44,626
Fat lot of good that will do me.

443
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:49,303
Major, l admire your fortitude.

444
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:51,841
Had l had the time and patience,

445
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,207
we might continue this game
indefinitely.

446
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:57,948
However...

447
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,308
...l have neither.

448
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,023
Catch.

449
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:17,630
Your name, please?

450
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,235
Garland Briggs.

451
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:24,170
Garland, what do you fear most
in the world?

452
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:28,611
The possibility
that love is not enough.

453
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:32,340
Oh, Garland, please, l shall weep.

454
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:35,251
How much does your wife weigh?

455
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,644
One hundred and fifteen pounds.

456
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:40,586
Oh, good for her.

457
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:45,594
Now, when did you first see
the petroglyph in Owl Cave?

458
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:48,756
ln-- ln dreams.

459
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,361
What kind of dreams?

460
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:56,897
l was night fishing
with Agent Cooper.

461
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:01,908
There was a light,
guardian beyond it.

462
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,683
l was taken, but my mind...

463
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,345
Still l recognized the signs.

464
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:13,682
What do the signs mean?

465
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:19,863
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet,

466
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,397
they will receive you.

467
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:33,540
Garland, Garland.

468
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:39,581
Garland, Garland, l was hoping
for a lengthy conversation.

469
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:42,914
Leo, put the major to bed.

470
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,286
l'm afraid his mind
has begun to wander.

471
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:53,056
There's a time,
if Jupiter and Saturn meet.

472
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,064
His woman servant, Jones,

473
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,901
delivered this to me
shortly after he died.

474
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,770
Eckhardt's last bequest.

475
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:09,971
A clever jape, perhaps,
or something of value.

476
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,942
Try this.

477
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:18,280
No, you see, there's a secret
to opening each of these boxes.

478
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:23,487
And this one
is about to drive me mad.

479
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:25,491
Oh, Andrew,
tell me something good.

480
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:31,428
Our foreign investors are chomping
at the bit from Paris to Beijing.

481
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:33,093
You're going to get your golf course.

482
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,603
Right next to
The Great Northern Hotel.

483
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,799
And Benjamin is doing everything
he can to stop us.

484
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:42,037
Well, it's too late. When the project
was still in his possession,

485
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:43,976
Ben cleared every possible hurdle:

486
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:47,379
The zoning, the impact statements.

487
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:52,854
He was and is
his own worst enemy.

488
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:54,787
As always. What are you doing?

489
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:58,793
Nothing, Catherine, l'm just trying
a few simple combinations.

490
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,557
- Let me, let me.
- No, Catherine.

491
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,996
Eckhardt's birthday.

492
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:12,909
My birthday.

493
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,173
The day the gift arrived.

494
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:26,186
Give it to me.

495
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:33,862
- Oh, what a bore.
- l opened it.

496
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,375
Andrew...

497
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:50,167
l'm not completely prepared for this.

498
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:53,902
Just think of it as a walking embrace,
all right?

499
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:58,412
Two people stepping
as one would step.

500
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:03,118
- So far, so good.
- Now, just follow me.

501
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,751
We'll follow each other.

502
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,157
Good.

503
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,119
lt's genetic memory.

504
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,764
Mom and Dad danced the lindy.

505
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,634
You've got it.

506
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:29,675
Your body feels nice against mine.

507
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,640
l was just thinking the same thing.

508
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,412
Listen, if l'm being too forward--

509
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:41,448
- l want more than your kisses.
- For instance?

510
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,184
- l want--
- This thing on?

511
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:50,563
Welcome to this final night
of festivities

512
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:56,867
celebrating the Miss Twin Peaks...

513
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:03,979
As some of you--
Damnation, is this damn thing on?

514
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:09,518
What l mean is
l understand why you hesitate,

515
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:12,053
why you treat me with care.

516
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:15,192
The convent evokes the image
of helpless women,

517
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,986
fearful of the thought of any emotion

518
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:21,530
other than those derived
from scripture and prayer.

519
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:25,562
But when you hold me,

520
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,861
when we kiss,

521
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:32,165
l feel safe and eager.

522
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,176
l'm not afraid

523
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:40,283
of anything
that you make me feel or want.

524
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:50,023
ls this on? ls this on?

525
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,128
l'm beginning to tire
of his interruptions.

526
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,422
- Welcome to...
- l don't know. l think he's cute.

527
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,035
- ...this final night of festivities...
- You do?

528
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,363
l think that maybe
l will enter after all.

529
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,239
- The Miss Twin Peaks contest?
- Why not?

530
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,571
''Hear the other side.
See the other side.''

531
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,714
There's worse places to start
than Miss Twin Peaks.

532
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:12,816
lt's like a fairy tale.

533
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:15,008
And you're the queen.

534
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,659
No.

535
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,613
What a gyp.

536
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,307
Finally meet the man of my dreams,

537
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:23,578
next thing l know,
he's on a plane to Brazil.

538
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,155
He'll be back one day.

539
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,851
- He promised.
- Yeah.

540
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:36,528
Well, he also promised
to take me fishing and we never did.

541
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,594
Love stinks.

542
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,369
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

543
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,034
Pearl Lake or something.

544
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,970
l have some tackle in the truck.

545
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,604
You do?

546
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:58,816
Audrey, there are many cures
for a broken heart,

547
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:04,555
but nothing quite like
a trout's leap in the moonlight.

548
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:09,663
May l?

549
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,638
You may.

550
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:29,685
Jupiter and Saturn meet

551
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:34,223
Oh, what a crop of mummy wheat

552
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:39,594
The planets our babbling major
spoke of are more than distant orbs.

553
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:41,789
They are, in fact, a clock.

554
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:43,797
A clock that tells the time.

555
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:45,900
And the time...

556
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,064
Time draws nearer
with each ticking tock.

557
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:52,299
Dale wasn't far wrong. The cave
painting is an invitation of sorts,

558
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,410
telling us when the revels begin.

559
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:58,378
But what Dale doesn't know
is where to find it.

560
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:02,575
For, you see, the cave painting
is not only an invitation,

561
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,812
it is also a map.

562
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:07,115
A map to the Black Lodge!

563
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:25,639
There's something wrong.

564
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:29,410
This isn't right.
There's something wrong here.
