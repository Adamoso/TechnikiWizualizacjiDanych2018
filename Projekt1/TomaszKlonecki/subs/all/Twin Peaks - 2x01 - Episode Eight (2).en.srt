1
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,335
Agent Cooper.

2
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:15,100
Can you hear me? It's Andy.

3
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:19,136
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.

4
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,309
Can you hear me?

5
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,006
Agent Cooper?

6
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,151
Room service.

7
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:50,008
How are you doing down there?

8
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,679
Warm milk.

9
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,975
Agent Cooper?

10
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,052
Would you put it on the table, please?

11
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:09,587
- And would you call a doctor?
- Sure.

12
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,526
Are you aII right? Can you hear me?

13
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,098
Agent Cooper.

14
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,928
Agent Cooper.

15
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:20,163
Agent Cooper, it's Andy.
Can you hear me?

16
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,372
Are you aII right?

17
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,712
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper.

18
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,609
Agent Cooper.

19
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,074
It's Andy.

20
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,617
It's An--

21
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:43,426
l hung it up for you.

22
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,260
What's that?

23
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:53,031
Hung it up for you.

24
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,334
Did you call the doctor?

25
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,907
The doctor?

26
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,654
lt's hung up.

27
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,947
The phone.

28
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,158
Thank you.

29
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:16,553
Sure.

30
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,295
No problem.

31
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,617
Does this include a gratuity?

32
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,378
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,828
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

34
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:09,811
The milk will get cool on you.

35
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:14,049
- Pretty soon.
- Okay.

36
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,331
l've heard about you.

37
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:05,599
l heard about you.

38
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:33,184
l will tell you three things.

39
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:39,097
lf l tell them to you
and they come true,

40
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,495
then will you believe me?

41
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:44,496
Who's that?

42
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:48,607
Think of me as a friend.

43
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,570
Where do you come from?

44
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,712
The question is,
where have you gone?

45
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,290
The first thing l will tell you is,

46
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:12,329
there's a man

47
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,956
in a smiling bag.

48
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,736
Man in a smiling bag.

49
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:24,570
Second thing is,

50
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:29,613
the owls are not what they seem.

51
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,980
Third thing is,

52
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:40,421
without chemicals, he points.

53
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:44,228
What do these things mean?

54
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,922
This is all l am permitted to say.

55
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,497
Give me your ring.

56
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,404
l will return it to you
when you find these things to be true.

57
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,853
We want to help you.

58
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,922
Who's ''we''?

59
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,528
One last thing.

60
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:23,627
Leo locked inside hungry horse.

61
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,533
There's a clue at Leo's house.

62
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,603
You will require medical attention.

63
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,601
Knock, knock, knock.

64
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,239
Come on.

65
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,648
Let's have a look at the new girl.

66
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:19,916
Vixen.

67
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,651
What room is Ben in?

68
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,866
The little flower room.

69
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,469
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What?

70
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:35,869
- Why is he holding out on me?
- What's that, Blackie?

71
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,478
Who's holding out on who?

72
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,243
Please.

73
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:46,675
Oh, Blackie.

74
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,022
You used to be so pretty.

75
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,999
Blackie, Blackie.

76
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,051
Bastard.

77
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,555
l think you should go now.

78
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:38,061
- Do you, Prudence?
- Yes, l do. l really do.

79
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,034
All right.

80
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,901
lf you insist.

81
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,822
Gotcha.

82
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,565
l will huff

83
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,068
and puff,

84
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:17,733
and blow your house down.

85
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,777
Oh, my, my.

86
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:24,439
Aren't you something?

87
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,981
l've got to see you. l must see you.

88
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:33,319
Go away. l'm shy.

89
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,984
Didn't they tell you who l was?

90
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,993
The owner?

91
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:40,394
That's right.

92
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:43,000
Ben, it's Jer.
We got a situation.

93
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,969
- So have l.
- Brother Ben, we got a S-N-A-G.

94
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,008
- Alas, l do have a situation.
- Come on, Ben.

95
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:52,610
Coming, Jer.

96
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,746
l like you.

97
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:59,078
You know how to interest a man.
That's half the battle.

98
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,881
Next time,
we will play a different game.

99
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,421
l'll make the rules.

100
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,958
You'll like it. Fun game.

101
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:13,623
Everybody wins.

102
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,803
Diane.

103
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,939
My recorder is on the table.

104
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:03,311
l'm unable to reach it at this time.

105
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:07,649
l can only hope
that l inadvertently pressed

106
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,015
the voice activation button.

107
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:14,021
l'm lying on the floor of my room.

108
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,355
l've been shot.

109
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:22,162
There's a great deal of pain
and a fair amount of blood.

110
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:27,203
Fortunately, l was wearing
my bulletproof vest last night,

111
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:31,571
per bureau regulations
when working undercover.

112
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:34,577
l remember folding the vest up,

113
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,875
trying to chase down a wood tick.

114
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,288
lf you can imagine the impact
on your chest

115
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,221
of three bowling balls dropped
from a height of about 9 feet,

116
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:52,228
you might begin
to approximate the sensation.

117
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:58,263
All things considered,

118
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:03,305
being shot is not as bad
as l always thought it might be.

119
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,145
As long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

120
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:13,918
But l guess you could say that
about almost anything in life.

121
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:19,049
lt's not so bad as long as you can keep
the fear from your mind.

122
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,170
Oh, my God.

123
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,805
The ring is gone.

124
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,141
At a time like this, curiously,

125
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,914
you begin to think
of the things you regret

126
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,557
or the things you might miss.

127
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:59,859
l would like, in general, to treat people
with much more care and respect.

128
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,830
l would like to climb a tall hill.

129
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:06,267
Not too tall.

130
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,999
Sit in the cool grass.

131
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,200
Not too cool.

132
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,505
And feel the sun on my face.

133
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:20,850
l wish l could have cracked
the Lindbergh kidnapping case.

134
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:25,855
l would very much like
to make love to a beautiful woman

135
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,153
who l had genuine affection for.

136
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:36,166
And of course, it goes without saying
that l would like to visit Tibet.

137
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:41,204
l wish they could get their country back
and the Dalai Lama could return.

138
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,537
Oh, l would like that very much.

139
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,472
All in all,
a very interesting experience.

140
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,325
They're here.

141
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:09,429
My skin was itching.

142
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:13,163
Wood tick was crawling.

143
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,937
l lifted my bulletproof vest.

144
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,776
Three slugs.

145
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:22,413
Point-blank range.

146
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,071
That explains this.

147
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,885
Hell of a way to kill a tick.

148
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,722
Did you get a look at the gunman?

149
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:43,434
l saw a masked face, muzzle flash.

150
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:51,266
Lucy, you better bring Agent Cooper
up-to-date.

151
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,171
Leo Johnson was shot.

152
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,646
Jacques Renault was strangled.

153
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:02,549
The mill burned.
Shelly and Pete got smoke inhalation.

154
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,882
Catherine and Josie are missing.

155
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:08,925
Nadine is in a coma
from taking sleeping pills.

156
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:16,697
- How long have l been out?
- lt's 7:45 in the morning.

157
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,961
We haven't had this much action
in one night

158
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,572
since the Elk's Club fire of '59.

159
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:27,645
Harry, we need to get a search warrant
for Leo Johnson's house.

160
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,806
No need. Leo was shot
in his own living room.

161
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:35,442
Deputy Brennan found him.

162
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:43,922
- You're not going anywhere.
- Doc. When the will is invoked,

163
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:48,032
the recuperative powers of the physical
body are simply extraordinary.

164
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:58,034
Just give me a couple of hours
to get dressed.

165
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:15,220
I'm standing just in front of
where a massive Iog-storage area

166
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:18,022
of the Packard Saw MiII
burned to the ground,

167
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:21,132
under what fire department
investigators are caIIing

168
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,029
''mysterious circumstances. ''

169
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,135
Now, poIice officiaIs have toId me
that they have, as of yet,

170
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,673
- Bobby.
- uncovered no apparent Iink

171
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,708
between these two
seemingIy unreIated

172
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:34,345
- Bobby.
- tragedies.

173
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,845
Reporting Iive
from the Packard Saw MiII...

174
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,574
Cooper, this is totally
against my recommendations.

175
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,309
lt's all right, doc. Duly noted.

176
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:43,978
You got two busted ribs,
your cartilage is a mess.

177
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,556
Who knows what else is wrong?

178
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,589
What's that?

179
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,089
Jacques Renault.

180
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,665
ls that bag smiling?

181
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,170
Smiling?

182
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,541
What's there to smile about?

183
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:32,489
Do you miss Beth?

184
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:34,957
What?

185
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,027
Have you been missing your mom?

186
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:46,406
- Aunt Sarah?
- Yeah?

187
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,910
l had the strangest dream last night.

188
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:51,939
About what?

189
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:57,479
The rug.

190
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:58,680
Right here.

191
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:02,722
Right from this angle
where l'm sitting.

192
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,058
Was Laura in it?

193
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:09,463
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

194
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,830
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

195
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,734
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

196
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:16,838
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

197
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,909
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

198
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,979
A IittIe bit jumbIed and jivey

199
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:25,082
Say, ''Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

200
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:30,016
And IittIe Iambs eat ivy''

201
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:31,588
Leland?

202
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:36,023
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

203
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,755
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

204
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,761
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

205
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:47,963
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

206
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,600
Morning, dears.

207
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:54,211
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

208
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:55,403
Oh, Leland.

209
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,711
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

210
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,777
Leland, come back here.

211
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,874
Oh, God.

212
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,979
Okay. Agenda.

213
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,879
One.

214
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,814
l want a location on Catherine.

215
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,956
Keep our distance, just make sure
she's ready to take the fall.

216
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,455
Two.

217
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,890
l want a complete medical
on Leo Johnson

218
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,653
and his prospects for recovery

219
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,459
and a satisfactory explanation
from Hank Jennings

220
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:52,900
why Leo isn't being measured
for a plot in Ghostwood Memorial Park.

221
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,904
Well begun is half done.

222
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:59,009
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

223
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,476
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

224
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:04,514
Oh, Mairzy Doats and Dozy Doats
And IiddIe Iamzy divey

225
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:06,810
A kiddIey divey too, wouIdn't you?

226
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:10,148
Now, if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear

227
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,790
A IittIe bit jumbIed and jivey

228
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,826
Say, ''Mares eat oats
And does eat oats

229
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:21,091
And IittIe Iambs eat ivy''

230
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:25,329
l'm back.

231
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:27,664
Back and ready.

232
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,115
But the bullet came from outside.

233
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,514
How do you figure?

234
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,186
Sheriff, a picture is forming.

235
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:47,052
Big ax on the couch.

236
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,286
These same geese were flying
that evening.

237
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,827
Leo was trying to turn someone
into kindling.

238
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,795
That person hit the TV, moved it.

239
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,298
You can see the depression
in the carpet.

240
00:25:58,604 --> 00:25:59,866
Shelly?

241
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,563
Shelly Johnson's about 99 pounds
soaking wet.

242
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,470
This is a big TV.

243
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,873
Leo advanced, ax raised.

244
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,206
Then what happened?

245
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:13,249
Bullet came through the window,
knocked Leo back onto the couch.

246
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:16,386
Do you think it was Shelly
who pulled the trigger?

247
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:20,184
Sheriff, get your mind off Shelly,
for a moment.

248
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,487
We won't know about Shelly until we
find out what time she got to the mill.

249
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:30,096
Surprise. FIesh WorId.

250
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,169
Hey, what issue is this?

251
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,897
Still no cocaine.
Here or in the truck.

252
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,597
But l found this in the truck.

253
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,766
Leo's duster.

254
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:42,775
- Reeks of gasoline.
- The mill.

255
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,013
Good work, Hawk.

256
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,354
Harry, do you know who it is?

257
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,429
Harry, do you know who it is?

258
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:01,395
- Harry.
- What's that?

259
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,296
- Harry, do you know who it is?
- lt's Andy.

260
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,266
He seems pretty upset
about something.

261
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:10,237
Harry, it's Agent Rosenflower.

262
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:26,951
Andy, are you all right?

263
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,256
Hey, Andy.

264
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:33,898
Are you all right?

265
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:54,112
And it's another great moment
in law enforcement history.

266
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,799
Hey, Albert.

267
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,839
Looks like you were more right
than you know.

268
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:24,441
Looks like a new pair of boots
and a lot of cocaine.

269
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:30,982
Andy.

270
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,550
Good work.

271
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,768
Hot damn that pie is good!

272
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,065
Here's Laura's glasses
that you wanted.

273
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,070
Thanks.

274
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,033
Thanks.

275
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:03,278
Donna, do you see these glasses
that l'm wearing?

276
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,938
Yeah.

277
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:14,284
l hate them.

278
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,593
l'm never wearing these again.

279
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:22,991
Okay.

280
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,432
ls it true about James?

281
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,584
He spent the night in jail.

282
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,280
Do you think
it's because of what we did?

283
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:48,256
Look, we don't know
if we did anything.

284
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:52,123
My dad said Jacoby got sick
because he was attacked.

285
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,288
All we did was send him a tape.

286
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,264
Maybe he wouldn't have been attacked
if we hadn't.

287
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,166
Maybe. Maybe the sun won't come
up tomorrow if you wash your hair.

288
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,433
Think like that and you're gonna
go crazy. What's done is done.

289
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,105
The only way this won't come back
to haunt us

290
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:12,045
is if we keep quiet
about what happened last night.

291
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,286
l can assure you
James is doing the same thing.

292
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,118
Get the picture?

293
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:26,358
Loud and clear.

294
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,134
Uncle Leland's hair turned white.

295
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:41,672
Really?

296
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:45,005
White as a sheet.

297
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,877
Weird.

298
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:53,854
Donna, l have something for you.

299
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,821
Came here to the Double R
yesterday.

300
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,061
Thanks, Norma.

301
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:15,603
- God.
- What is it?

302
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:26,217
''Look into the Meals on Wheels.''

303
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,583
How simple can l make it, Cooper?

304
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,160
FBl agent gets shot,
FBl agent investigates.

305
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:08,288
l'm in proximity, work in the Seattle lab,
l'm familiar with the underlying case.

306
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:10,127
- Does that hurt?
- Yes.

307
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:14,068
Albert, the point is, you're not gonna
win any local popularity contests.

308
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:17,673
No, the point is
Gordon Cole ordered me back here.

309
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,445
Breathe.

310
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,674
Again.

311
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,612
Okay.

312
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:35,086
You were shot by a right-handed
person, 5'6'' to 5'1 0'' tall,

313
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:38,285
at a distance of less than 3 feet.
l'll have ballistics this afternoon.

314
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:40,862
- You're still blank on the other details?
- Yes.

315
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,293
What was your vest doing
riding up like that?

316
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:44,995
Wood tick.

317
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:49,931
Meanwhile, one of your principal
suspects is killed in his hospital bed,

318
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,939
the other is shot in his living room.

319
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,442
Vigilante justice
or just clean country living?

320
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:58,479
Albert, where does this attitude of
general unpleasantness come from?

321
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:00,480
l'll have to get back to you on that.

322
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,779
lf you don't want two black eyes
on a regular basis,

323
00:34:02,954 --> 00:34:05,787
l suggest you make
some kind of peace with rural life.

324
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,391
Great. After the square dance,
maybe we can all take a hayride.

325
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:12,186
Come in.

326
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,598
Andy, how's the nose?

327
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:19,798
Not a mark on it,
only blood squirted out.

328
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:21,729
Where do they keep his water dish?

329
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,467
Albert.

330
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,701
Agent Cooper, guess what.

331
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,507
l have the answer to the riddle
that you told me this morning.

332
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:33,013
l called Hungry Horse, Montana.

333
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,049
The word ''locked.''

334
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,021
Leo Johnson was locked in a jail
in Hungry Horse, Montana.

335
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:42,493
When, Andy?

336
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,632
''February 9, 1 988.''

337
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,209
Teresa Banks.

338
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:04,946
Looks like Leo has an alibi for the night
Teresa Banks was murdered.

339
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,652
Good work, Andy.

340
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,351
Yeah.

341
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:39,746
Excuse me.

342
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:45,679
- ls Sheriff Truman here?
- He is, but he is busy at the moment.

343
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,193
May l help you?

344
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,390
l'm afraid l don't have an appointment.

345
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:57,160
The sheriff asked me to stop by

346
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,428
at my convenience.

347
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,435
This is the first convenient moment.

348
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,306
May l ask what this is regarding?

349
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:11,246
l'm here to sell him some shoes.

350
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:26,963
Shoes?

351
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:32,168
Here comes Mom
with miIk and cookies.

352
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,032
Later, Lawrence.

353
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,831
Bye-bye.

354
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:41,972
You got this tape
from Dr. Jacoby's office?

355
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:43,306
Yeah.

356
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,711
That's breaking and entering, James.

357
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,181
The door was open.

358
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,377
How did you know
Jacoby wouldn't be there?

359
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:51,852
l knocked, nobody answered.

360
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:55,818
- You were alone?
- Yeah.

361
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:01,461
Okay. l know
you were trying to help,

362
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:04,193
but there's some people
who might not see it that way.

363
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,337
Especially with 3 ounces of cocaine
in your gas tank.

364
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:09,370
You know l didn't put that there.

365
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,907
l think it was probably
Mike and Bobby.

366
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,069
- Yeah.
- Harry,

367
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:16,872
Laura talks on her tape
about a mystery man.

368
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,675
A red Corvette. Leo Johnson.

369
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:22,375
l think it was somebody else.
Not Jacques Renault either.

370
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:25,386
- Why do you say that?
- l never put it together

371
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:29,323
until l heard the tape. Where she says,
''This guy can really light my fire.''

372
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:34,192
Well, l remember this one night when
we first started seeing each other.

373
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:35,992
She was still doing drugs then.

374
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:41,105
Well, we were in the woods and
she started saying this scary poem,

375
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,536
over and over, about fire.

376
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,606
And then she said,

377
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:48,573
''Would you like to play with fire,
little boy?''

378
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:51,340
''Would you like to play with Bob?''

379
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:54,583
''Would you like to play with Bob?''

380
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:00,115
- What did she mean by that?
- l don't know.

381
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,055
Laura said a lot of nutty stuff.

382
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,829
Half the time,
it just went right by you.

383
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,562
This stuck, though.

384
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:17,397
James, l'll get right to the point.

385
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,442
l know you have the other half
of Laura Palmer's necklace.

386
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,206
l want it. Give it to me.

387
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:26,208
How?

388
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:31,387
Well, this was in Jacoby's office.

389
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,858
lt was in a coconut.

390
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,591
A coconut?

391
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,767
Hawk, take James back to his cell.

392
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:50,899
Jacoby?

393
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,442
How did you know
he had the necklace?

394
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,910
Laura and James were in love.

395
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:59,777
l figured he had to have
the other half of the necklace,

396
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,316
but if he had the other half,

397
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:04,455
he would have given it to us
to help with the case.

398
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:06,684
Then it dawned on me.

399
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:10,258
Something or someone
frightened him off.

400
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:13,090
He had to have it,
so l asked him for it.

401
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,496
Jacoby?

402
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:20,527
l didn't figure he had anything
to do with this at all.

403
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,703
Sometimes you just get lucky.

404
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,790
Donna?

405
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,334
Hi, Lucy.

406
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:01,208
l'm here to see James.

407
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,273
How are you doing?

408
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,046
Did you tell them anything?

409
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,280
They haven't asked me anything.

410
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,257
When did you start smoking?

411
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:53,492
l smoke every once in a while.

412
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:56,930
Helps relieve tension.

413
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,026
When did you get so tense?

414
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:03,370
When l started smoking.

415
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:07,134
Did you tell them anything?

416
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:10,405
l didn't tell them
about you or Maddy.

417
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,440
Do they think Leo killed Laura?

418
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:16,215
l don't know what they think.

419
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:17,880
How is Maddy?

420
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,087
She's fine.

421
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,062
She hasn't said anything either.

422
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,403
So don't you wanna kiss me?

423
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,344
What's wrong?

424
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,786
Nothing's wrong.

425
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:07,365
Or is it just not okay
for me to want you?

426
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:14,440
Get out soon, James.

427
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,307
Lucy.

428
00:42:53,384 --> 00:42:55,011
Andy.

429
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:00,052
ln these boxes
is every edition of FIesh WorId

430
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:03,091
published for the past three years.

431
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,889
This is a picture of Teresa Banks,
the first victim,

432
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:09,555
who was found murdered a year ago
in the southern part of the state.

433
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:13,226
Now, Laura and Ronette's photographs
appeared in ads in the magazines.

434
00:43:13,404 --> 00:43:17,738
You want us to look for a picture
of Teresa Banks.

435
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:20,104
Andy, you're way ahead of me.

436
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,406
Lucy, Sheriff Truman and l
will be at the hospital.

437
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:25,344
Behave yourselves.

438
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:30,921
Diane, just received the back issues
of FIesh WorId. Good work.

439
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:32,851
lt's nice to see some cooperation
with the law,

440
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:36,050
especially from a company
that preys on human weaknesses.

441
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:44,624
Lucy, l sure feel uncomfortable
being in this situation with you.

442
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:48,465
Why? We're both professionals.

443
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,944
ls he on something?

444
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:03,819
Only what you prescribed.

445
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:12,323
l think he did take
a little bit of his food.

446
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,987
My God, could that be it?

447
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:27,668
Agent Cooper.

448
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,472
Why don't you tell the psychiatrist

449
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:33,014
about your broken ribs
and torn cartilage.

450
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:38,982
Well, well, well.

451
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:44,155
What happened to you?

452
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:50,698
l don't want any baloney, magic tricks
or psychological mumbo jumbo.

453
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:54,099
l want you to tell us
how you came into possession of this

454
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:59,033
or l am gonna have to place you
under arrest for obstruction of justice.

455
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:08,951
Look, l told you.

456
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,886
The night after Laura died,
l followed a man in a red Corvette.

457
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,781
Leo Johnson.

458
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,025
Correct.

459
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:23,394
Then he eluded me somewhere
near the old sawmill road.

460
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,903
As l sat there, cursing my--

461
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:31,132
My lack of horsepower,

462
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:33,833
a motorcycle drove by.

463
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:37,479
Followed by a police cruiser.

464
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,381
But you lost them.

465
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,046
They went into the woods.

466
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,016
l saw them.
l followed them in there on foot.

467
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:51,555
- James and Donna?
- Yes, they...

468
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:55,324
They spoke intently for a while, but
l couldn't hear what they were saying.

469
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,066
I remember it was...

470
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:02,069
It was a coId night in the woods.

471
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:04,899
FinaIIy, they...

472
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:08,512
They buried something in the ground,
under a rock.

473
00:46:14,852 --> 00:46:18,015
lll-advisedly, perhaps,

474
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,180
l took it as a keepsake.

475
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:28,121
lt was her, you see.

476
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:31,393
The necklace.

477
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,730
A divided heart.

478
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:37,931
Laura was--

479
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,201
Was, in fact...

480
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,742
Well, she was living a double life.

481
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,641
Two people.

482
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:46,983
Yeah, but then...

483
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:53,318
Then when l saw her
that last time, she...

484
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:56,892
l don't know, she seemed
to have reached a kind of--

485
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:59,154
A peace with herself.

486
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:02,127
Now l believe that

487
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,301
what she had in fact arrived at

488
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:07,937
was a decision to end her life.

489
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:11,738
Are you saying Laura wanted to die?

490
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:13,068
Doctor,

491
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,746
Laura Palmer
did not commit suicide.

492
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:19,239
No, no.

493
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:24,319
But maybe she allowed herself
to be killed.

494
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,364
One more thing.

495
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:45,168
You were in intensive care last night
when Jacques Renault was killed.

496
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:49,176
Yeah, yes.
But l mean, come on, fellows.

497
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:51,337
l was heavily sedated and...

498
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:54,143
Did you see anything? Hear anything?

499
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:59,722
l remember hearing
a fire alarm go off, but...

500
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,825
lt's...

501
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,463
lt's all like a...

502
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,122
Like a dream.

503
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:15,934
There was a smell.

504
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:21,841
Yeah, there was a peculiar smell.

505
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:27,707
lt's usual in case of strangulation
for the victim to void his bowels.

506
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:37,691
No.

507
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,186
No, that wasn't it, this...

508
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,157
This was a smell like...

509
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,694
Like oil.

510
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:56,073
Scorched engine oil.

511
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:02,047
Dr. BradIey, caII the operator.

512
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:05,882
Dr. BradIey,
caII the operator, pIease.

513
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:30,308
Hey, sleeping beauty.

514
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:33,880
Bobby.

515
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:45,258
What are you doing here?
What if someone sees you?

516
00:49:45,429 --> 00:49:50,526
l don't care.
l do not care anymore.

517
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:53,899
Leo's in the hospital.

518
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:55,561
Somebody shot him.

519
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,836
Yeah, l know. l mean, l heard
there's cops outside his room.

520
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:04,310
- Really?
- l hear they're gonna bust him.

521
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:08,110
He must have got caught
doing something, poor bastard.

522
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:13,354
What happened to you?

523
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:18,959
Bobby, l'm so afraid.

524
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,661
Leo tried to kill me.

525
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,327
He knows about us.

526
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:28,533
He took me up to the mill,

527
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:31,869
and he tied me up
and started the fire.

528
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,171
Bobby,

529
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:37,314
he told me he was gonna kill you.

530
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,283
Fat chance.

531
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:43,810
l won't let him hurt us anymore.

532
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,716
Are you all right?

533
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,627
Doctors seem to think so.

534
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:03,330
You know, Shelly,
hospitals are dangerous places.

535
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:06,670
First of all, they're crawling
with sick people.

536
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:10,109
And second of all,
that food can kill you.

537
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:15,016
So if you wanna
get out of here pronto,

538
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:18,313
you're gonna have to let Bobby
be your doctor.

539
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:24,687
So let's just have a look here,
Miss Shelly.

540
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:33,069
Oh, you seem to be
coming along splendidly.

541
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,735
Deep breath.

542
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:44,941
l'd say you're on your way
to a complete recovery.

543
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,091
You better go.

544
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:02,695
You're my girl.

545
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:06,726
Bobby.

546
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:11,699
l love you.

547
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:20,813
l guess l love you too.

548
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:39,194
Yeah, l guess l love you too.

549
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:50,705
Bobby Briggs.

550
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:57,248
- What's he doing here?
- He doesn't look sick.

551
00:52:57,421 --> 00:53:00,515
Sheriff Truman, to see this kind
of investigative genius at work,

552
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:03,454
it's just a real treat for me.

553
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:09,455
Ed.

554
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:14,763
How are you doing?
l heard you stopped a couple.

555
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:17,964
l'm okay. How's Nadine?

556
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:20,438
Well, she's in a coma.

557
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,375
They say there's nothing we could do.
She has to wanna come back.

558
00:53:23,547 --> 00:53:25,139
How are you holding up?

559
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:27,510
Well, all l can do is sit here,

560
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:30,278
thinking about the things
l should have said or done.

561
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:32,979
Ed, don't be too hard on yourself.

562
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:36,851
l never believed in fate,
Agent Cooper.

563
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:38,289
l always felt

564
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:42,159
you make your own way, you take care
of your own, you pick up after yourself.

565
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:44,664
Farmer's AImanac?

566
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:47,565
Albert, l would like
to speak to Ed.

567
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:50,706
Albert, l'll buy you a cup of coffee.

568
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,410
Take a seat, Ed.

569
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:00,410
l saw this coming.

570
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,313
l didn't wanna believe it.

571
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:05,750
What's worse is l'm sitting thinking
that maybe there's a part of me

572
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,323
that didn't wanna stop her.

573
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,187
And that's a full load.

574
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:13,686
When did you get married, Ed?

575
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:16,094
Right out of high school.

576
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,426
Norma and l had been together
about four years.

577
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:22,698
Everybody figured we'd get hitched.
That'd be that.

578
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:25,364
l barely knew Nadine to say hello to.

579
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,174
That spring, one bad weekend,

580
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,848
Norma ran off with Hank.

581
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:34,313
l was so twisted up inside,
l couldn't see straight.

582
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:37,315
When l opened my eyes,

583
00:54:38,088 --> 00:54:40,181
there was Nadine,
right in front of me.

584
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:43,623
There was something so sweet,

585
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,328
so helpless about her.

586
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,195
We drove all night.

587
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:53,769
Ended up in some little town
in Montana, out past Great Falls,

588
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:55,268
and l asked her to marry me.

589
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,473
Half joking, half drunk, half crazy.

590
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:03,943
lt was light before we found
a justice of the peace.

591
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:06,274
And Norma...

592
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:09,374
Well, she hadn't even
slept with Hank.

593
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,452
The look on her face
when she found out...

594
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:19,218
Nadine and l, we went up to my dad's
old cabin up in Eagle Pass.

595
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,488
Honeymoon.

596
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:24,429
l was hoping maybe we'd get around
to talking about a divorce,

597
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:27,497
annulment, something.

598
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:30,162
But Nadine was so happy.

599
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:34,235
And you know, by golly,

600
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:36,879
l shot out Nadine's eye
on that honeymoon.

601
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,379
What do you mean, Ed?

602
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,649
The first day,
we were hunting pheasant.

603
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:47,516
Nadine's a crack shot
and we already had a couple of birds.

604
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:49,515
And l felt good shooting.

605
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:53,857
Listening to the sound echoing,
roll down those hills.

606
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:55,430
l fired.

607
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,467
A piece of buckshot skipped off a rock
and caught Nadine square in the eye.

608
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,134
Man, that's a tough one.

609
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,569
She laid across my lap
as we drove back to town.

610
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,105
She never cried.

611
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:10,639
She never blamed me.

612
00:56:10,814 --> 00:56:13,476
She never hated me for it.

613
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:18,150
Couple of months later,
Norma married Hank.

614
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:22,314
So l don't believe in fate.
You make your bed, you sleep in it.

615
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,455
Sorry.

616
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,861
Ed, someone here to see you.

617
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:54,513
A man in a smiling bag.

618
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:08,167
Take James right back to the station
when you're done here.

619
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:11,272
Poor Ed.

620
00:57:11,475 --> 00:57:13,409
Poor Nadine.

621
00:57:14,211 --> 00:57:16,736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

622
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,209
Albert, why don't you
take this opportunity

623
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:21,782
to check in
at The Great Northern.

624
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:32,793
Nurse, l really mean it,
you better speak to that kitchen.

625
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:55,912
Harry, when Albert finishes up
at The Great Northern,

626
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:57,485
we'll meet back at the station.

627
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:00,122
l'm ready to lay the whole thing out.

628
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,484
Rocks and bottles?

629
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:04,491
Chalk and blackboard
will be just fine.

630
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:08,062
- Jelly doughnuts?
- Harry, that goes without saying.

631
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:11,257
l'll come back later
and l'll bring some soup.

632
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:14,335
The food in these places will kill you
quicker than most diseases.

633
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:16,497
So l hear.

634
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,641
Now, you know
l have a sweet tooth too.

635
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:21,470
l've got
a chocolate-peanut butter pie.

636
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:24,113
Norma, l'm serious.

637
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,579
Bring the whole pie.

638
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:29,778
l'll bring you two.

639
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:31,784
Okay.

640
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:35,781
- Feel better, sweetie.
- Bye.

641
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,056
Bye.

642
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,683
Son.

643
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:46,989
Dad.

644
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:51,398
Would you...

645
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:53,559
...care to join me?

646
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:58,264
Okay.

647
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:14,087
How was school today?

648
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:18,490
School?

649
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:21,924
Fine.

650
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,560
That's good.

651
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:29,735
How was work?

652
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:32,765
Work? Work was good.

653
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:43,212
- Dad?
- Yes, son.

654
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:48,546
What is it that you do, exactly?

655
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,119
That's classified.

656
01:00:58,335 --> 01:01:00,929
Bobby, would you care
for a piece of pie?

657
01:01:01,972 --> 01:01:04,668
The huckleberries are particularly
delicious today.

658
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:07,570
Particularly fresh and delicious.

659
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:10,840
No, thanks.

660
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:19,917
Bobby,

661
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:23,053
may l share something with you?

662
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:25,792
Okay.

663
01:01:26,262 --> 01:01:29,322
A vision l had in my sleep last night.

664
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,861
As distinguished from a dream,

665
01:01:32,102 --> 01:01:34,297
which is mere sorting
and cataloging

666
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:37,372
of the day's events
by the subconscious.

667
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:40,770
This was a vision.

668
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:44,175
Fresh and clear
as a mountain stream.

669
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:48,207
The mind revealing itself to itself.

670
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,787
ln my vision,

671
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:55,652
l was on the veranda
of a vast estate,

672
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:59,693
a palazzo
of some fantastic proportion.

673
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:03,993
There seemed to emanate from it
a light from within this

674
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:07,625
gleaming, radiant marble.

675
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:13,003
l'd known this place. l had, in fact,
been born and raised there.

676
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:15,736
This was my first return.

677
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:22,640
A reunion with the deepest
well springs of my being.

678
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:27,155
Wandering about, l noticed happily

679
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,850
that the house had been
immaculately maintained.

680
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:34,360
There had been added a number
of additional rooms,

681
01:02:35,265 --> 01:02:40,396
but in a way that blended so seamlessly
with the original construction,

682
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:43,903
one would never detect
any difference.

683
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:47,566
Returning to the house's
grand foyer,

684
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:50,405
there came a knock at the door.

685
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,547
My son was standing there.

686
01:02:56,152 --> 01:03:00,020
He was happy and carefree.

687
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:05,384
Clearly living a life
of deep harmony and joy.

688
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:10,029
We embraced.

689
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,863
A warm and loving embrace,
nothing withheld.

690
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:19,171
We were, in this moment, one.

691
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:32,618
My vision ended and l awoke
with a tremendous feeling

692
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:36,725
of optimism and confidence

693
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,554
in you and your future.

694
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:42,326
That was my vision of you.

695
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,333
Really?

696
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:51,400
l'm so glad to have had this opportunity
to share it with you.

697
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:05,285
l wish you nothing
but the very best in all things.

698
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,622
Thank you, Dad.

699
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:11,017
- See you later. Call.
- Okay.

700
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,202
Major?

701
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:23,430
How was the pie?

702
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:25,130
Exceptional, as always.

703
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,951
How is Shelly?

704
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:46,961
l can't talk right now.

705
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:50,997
Well, how did she like the flowers?

706
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:26,157
The night Laura Palmer was killed, it
appears she made two appointments.

707
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:29,362
ln her diary she had written,
''Nervous about meeting J tonight.''

708
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:31,734
l now believe this was a reference
to James Hurley.

709
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:33,838
She was nervous
because she planned to tell him

710
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:35,443
she didn't wanna see him anymore.

711
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:38,172
Before she snuck out of the house,
she received a phone call.

712
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:41,072
We believe it was Leo Johnson
making the second appointment

713
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:42,513
for sometime later that night.

714
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,383
Laura met James,
was with him until 1 2:30,

715
01:05:45,555 --> 01:05:48,023
when, at the intersection
of Sparkwood and 21 ,

716
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,455
she jumped from the bike
and ran into the woods.

717
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,027
We believe she met up there
with Jacques Renault,

718
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:55,460
Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski.

719
01:05:55,632 --> 01:05:58,624
Together, they drove to the foot
of the trail leading to Jacques's cabin.

720
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:02,464
They climbed the trail, they were heard
passing by the cabin of the Log Lady.

721
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,472
They reached Jacques Renault's cabin
at approximately 1 a.m.

722
01:06:05,642 --> 01:06:08,133
Drugs and alcohol were consumed.
Laura was tied up

723
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:10,778
and had sexual relations
with both Leo and Jacques.

724
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:13,313
Waldo the bird was let out of his cage
and attacked Laura.

725
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:16,316
Leo and Jacques fought.
Jacques went outside and passed out.

726
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:18,818
When he came to,
Leo and the girls were gone.

727
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:22,253
We believe Leo hiked back down
the trail to his Corvette alone,

728
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:23,892
leaving the girls behind.

729
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,290
The reason being,
there was a third man.

730
01:06:26,462 --> 01:06:28,396
Deputy Hawk found evidence
of a third man

731
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:30,623
outside the window
of Jacques's cabin.

732
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,667
The third man took Laura and Ronette
to the train where they were tied up.

733
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,168
Laura for the second time,
Ronette for the first.

734
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:38,431
Using a blunt object,
the killer hit Ronette

735
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:39,973
and knocked her unconscious.

736
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:42,111
He must have been so intent
on killing Laura,

737
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:45,679
he didn't realize that Ronette
regained consciousness and escaped.

738
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:48,316
Either he didn't know
or he didn't care.

739
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:50,475
He made a small mound of dirt

740
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:53,019
and put the half-heart necklace
of Laura's on top.

741
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:57,649
He then placed a small cut out letter R
under the nail of her left ring finger.

742
01:06:57,827 --> 01:07:02,127
You'll recall that he placed the letter T
under the fingernail of Teresa Banks.

743
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:06,257
He left a note written in blood,
''Fire walk with me.''

744
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:07,926
Here's the interesting thing.

745
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:10,834
The blood on the note was tested.
lt doesn't match Leo's,

746
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:13,202
Jacques's, Laura's or Ronette's.

747
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:16,469
So we surmise the killer wrote the note
in his own blood.

748
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:18,307
lt's a rare type, AB negative.

749
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:23,049
The towel that Deputy Hawk found
five miles down the tracks

750
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:24,811
was soaked in blood of that type.

751
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:28,821
He also found, near the towel,
scraps of faded paper.

752
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:31,152
These scraps may have been left
by the killer.

753
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:34,125
They'll be sent back
to Washington D.C. for testing.

754
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,467
l know, Andy.
l know, l know, l know.

755
01:07:48,644 --> 01:07:51,511
lt's what we call
a real three-hankie crime.

756
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,380
Albert Rozerfeld,

757
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:04,925
l don't like the way you talk smart
about Sheriff Truman or anybody.

758
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:06,891
You just shut your mouth!

759
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:27,679
Laura Palmer is dead.

760
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,045
Jacques Renault is dead.

761
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:33,848
Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson
are in comas.

762
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:36,218
Waldo the bird is dead.

763
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,523
This leaves only the third man.

764
01:08:56,746 --> 01:09:01,115
- You want this door closed?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll frost our rooms.

765
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:07,453
- l sure do appreciate the ride, Harry.
- No problem.

766
01:09:08,257 --> 01:09:11,090
l always appreciate
your company, Pete.

767
01:09:12,428 --> 01:09:18,924
Boy, this smoke inhalation
is nasty business.

768
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:26,569
l feel like somebody taped my lips
to the tailpipe of a bus.

769
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:36,043
Take her easy.

770
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:43,816
- So where the hell is Josie?
- Oh, well, maybe this will tell us.

771
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:51,359
''Dear Pete,

772
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:55,099
l had to leave the town

773
01:09:55,271 --> 01:10:01,107
on an emergency
of business to Seattle.

774
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:05,439
l will phone you when l arrive.

775
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:09,278
Hope you did a good day
at the mill.

776
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:15,948
There is ginger beer in the refrig.
Love, Josie.'' There you go.

777
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:18,790
- ls there a phone number in there?
- No.

778
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:22,328
- Does she say where she's staying?
- No, no, she goes off to Seattle

779
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:26,366
once every three months or so.

780
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:32,372
You want my opinion, l think she goes
over there to indulge a secret vice.

781
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:35,839
- What's that?
- Shopping.

782
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,242
Comes back
with half a department store.

783
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:54,686
Pete,

784
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:58,330
we haven't found Catherine.

785
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:02,363
Yeah.

786
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:05,564
l figured.

787
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:09,609
l know you wanna hope for the best,

788
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:12,077
but you ought to prepare for the worst.

789
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:15,275
Oh, dear.

790
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:23,047
l always figured
l'd be the one to go first.

791
01:11:23,926 --> 01:11:25,917
l mean, if you was laying odds

792
01:11:26,095 --> 01:11:29,724
on the last person standing
after an atomic war,

793
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:31,594
l'd have bet on her.

794
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:37,862
Yeah, she was a tiger, all right.

795
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:45,079
No use mincing words,
she was plain hell to live with.

796
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,610
Plain hell.

797
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:53,115
But...

798
01:11:54,256 --> 01:11:58,317
...once, there was a little bit
of heaven there too.

799
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:01,156
Oh, l'm sure there was.

800
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:03,389
Oh, God.

801
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,634
This will take a little while
to sink in, l suppose.

802
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:10,265
l suppose it will.

803
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:17,745
God help her miserable soul.

804
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:20,707
l loved her.

805
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:35,089
Blue Pine Lodge.

806
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,356
Could l speak to Josie Packard,
please?

807
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:41,025
- WeII, she's not here right now.
- Can you tell me when she'll be back?

808
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:43,364
Well, she's out of town.
Who's calling?

809
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,749
l'd like to place
an international call, please.

810
01:12:56,385 --> 01:12:59,616
Collect to Hong Kong.

811
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:03,119
Doesn't that sound...?

812
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:05,886
l mean, l ate it,
but l didn't really know what it was.

813
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:07,962
l read about it in this French magazine,

814
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:13,466
and they take the entire head and dip it
in a kind of blancmange pudding.

815
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:18,539
And then they roll it in oats and stuff it
full of walnuts and hot rocks

816
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,642
- and a spice cookie.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

817
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,301
- They wrap it in papiIIon.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

818
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:27,711
They seal the edges
with a sugar glaze

819
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,317
- and bake it under glass.
- Mr. Horne, Mr. Horne.

820
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:31,748
That sounds incredible.

821
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:35,357
lt is to die for.

822
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:39,153
Have you seen Audrey today?

823
01:13:39,328 --> 01:13:41,296
No, l haven't.

824
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,107
Hank Jennings.

825
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,108
Jerry and Benjamin Horne.

826
01:14:05,354 --> 01:14:07,254
Where's Josie?

827
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:09,550
She left last night.

828
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:13,892
Prearranged?

829
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:18,329
She wanted to put a little distance
between her and the smell of smoke.

830
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,533
Sound strategy.

831
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:25,440
Next business, Leo Johnson.

832
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,633
He's in a coma.

833
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,572
Looks like brain damage.

834
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:32,942
With Leo, how could they tell?

835
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:36,818
Why isn't he dead?

836
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:40,945
l caught him center shot with a .44.

837
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,091
Couldn't risk going inside.

838
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:46,990
Neighborhood was hot.
l had to sneak past patrols as it was.

839
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:48,790
Anybody see you?

840
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,955
Negative.

841
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:53,658
He was chopping wood.

842
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,463
Chopping wood? lnside?

843
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,573
- Yeah, you know Leo.
- Wait a minute.

844
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,972
- Chopping wood inside?
- Yeah.

845
01:15:02,178 --> 01:15:03,941
You know Leo.

846
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:09,146
All right. What's next?

847
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:11,416
Catherine.

848
01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:15,016
Dead?

849
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:18,991
My phone call put her in the drying
shed when the place went up.

850
01:15:19,161 --> 01:15:21,925
Sounds like buried
with the wreckage.

851
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:26,591
Heat like that,
they'll be lucky to find teeth.

852
01:15:27,536 --> 01:15:30,334
And they were such pretty teeth.

853
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:33,004
Marvelous.

854
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:35,006
Marvelous.

855
01:15:35,177 --> 01:15:37,475
Gentlemen,

856
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,844
if they don't hang the arson
on the late lamented Catherine

857
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:45,453
and her co-conspirator Leo,

858
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:48,055
l'll give up sex.

859
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,319
That's confidence.

860
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,623
What do we do with the ledger?

861
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,925
Hank,

862
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:02,864
you leave the creative thinking
to the brothers Horne.

863
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:06,701
You're a bicep.
Relax until we say, ''Flex.''

864
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:14,179
Now, that really makes me mad.

865
01:16:21,657 --> 01:16:23,818
You guys.

866
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:33,895
Come in.

867
01:16:55,858 --> 01:16:58,383
Why is the door to my room locked?

868
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,495
And who's the refrigerator?

869
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:09,427
The owner was a little disappointed
in your performance last night.

870
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:17,378
Well, the owner isn't exactly my type.

871
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:38,393
And what is your type exactly?

872
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:45,438
Not you. No offense.

873
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:53,076
Hey.

874
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:58,115
Let's get one thing straight
between us, princess.

875
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:01,346
Okay.

876
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:04,583
l don't wanna hear another complaint
about you.

877
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,250
When you work for me,

878
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:08,992
everybody's your type.

879
01:18:25,214 --> 01:18:27,011
Norma?

880
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:30,114
Hi, it's Donna.

881
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,353
l'm calling about Meals on Wheels.

882
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:38,851
l'm gonna take over Laura's route
if that's okay with you.

883
01:18:40,796 --> 01:18:42,491
Okay.

884
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:44,959
Great.

885
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:49,337
Listen, can l use the Double R
station wagon?

886
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:52,867
All right.

887
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,200
Great.

888
01:18:57,246 --> 01:18:59,476
Then l'll see you tomorrow at 9.

889
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:14,491
Gersten's gonna tell us
about tonight's proceedings.

890
01:19:14,663 --> 01:19:18,690
She has some very good news.
We're all very proud of her.

891
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:19,891
Good evening.

892
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:22,731
l'm Gersten Hayward
and l'd like to welcome you all

893
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:24,566
to the Hayward Supper Club.

894
01:19:27,076 --> 01:19:28,907
l'm going to be playing
various selections

895
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:30,375
of music for you this evening.

896
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:32,870
My good news is
that l was chosen

897
01:19:33,048 --> 01:19:35,608
to be the fairy princess
in my school play.

898
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:38,116
This is my special dress.

899
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:41,586
Also, l got the highest scores
in mathematics and English

900
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:42,951
this mid-season term.

901
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,592
Just as my sisters Harriet
and Donna did before me.

902
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:49,094
So now l don't have to worry
about being ashamed anymore.

903
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:53,459
Before l play,
Harriet would like to read a poem

904
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:56,968
about your daughter
and our friend Laura.

905
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:21,554
It was Laura

906
01:20:22,264 --> 01:20:25,392
And I saw her gIowing

907
01:20:25,934 --> 01:20:28,129
In the dark woods

908
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:31,466
I saw her smiIing

909
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:36,275
We were crying and I saw her

910
01:20:37,246 --> 01:20:39,271
Laughing

911
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:44,309
In our sadness
I saw her dancing

912
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:48,320
It was Laura Iiving in my dreams

913
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,954
It was Laura

914
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:55,526
The gIow was Iife

915
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:58,325
Her smiIe was to say

916
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,263
It was aII right to cry

917
01:21:02,471 --> 01:21:05,133
The woods was our sadness

918
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:09,770
The dance was her caIIing

919
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:12,637
It was Laura

920
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,675
And she came to kiss me goodbye

921
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:32,834
That was wonderful. Thank you.

922
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:44,702
Gersten.

923
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,908
Now l'm going to play Mendelssohn's
''Rondo Capriccioso, Opus 1 4.''

924
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:38,623
l got the list and map
for Meals on Wheels.

925
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,768
l'm going to start tomorrow.

926
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:42,767
Aces.

927
01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:48,334
Long day, Will?

928
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:55,982
l feel like l've sat through
back-to-back operas.

929
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:59,985
ln med school, we learned to live
on three hours a night and cat naps.

930
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:02,248
lt's terrible about the mill.

931
01:23:02,424 --> 01:23:05,723
Yeah. They say more
than 1 50 jobs may be lost.

932
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:08,294
Awful. Just awful.

933
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:11,227
l suppose this will open the door

934
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,337
for Ben Horne
and his big development plans.

935
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:18,996
Well, as his lawyer, and yours,

936
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:22,075
of course l can't comment.

937
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:25,509
Well, as your doctor, Leland,

938
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:28,309
what the hell happened to your hair?

939
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,418
lt is strange, isn't it?

940
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:33,679
Well, l just...

941
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:36,824
l woke up this morning,
looked in the mirror and there it was.

942
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:39,290
lt had literally changed overnight.

943
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:41,929
Well, considering
all you've been through...

944
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:44,088
You know, the funny thing about it is,

945
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:47,258
seeing it, l realized that l had

946
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,870
turned a corner somehow.

947
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:53,132
l feel a great deal
of sadness still, yes,

948
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,277
but it wasn't as overwhelming to me.

949
01:23:56,445 --> 01:24:00,779
l physically felt as if a great weight
had been lifted from my heart.

950
01:24:01,616 --> 01:24:03,777
- Perhaps it has.
- Perhaps it has.

951
01:24:03,985 --> 01:24:05,680
Perhaps it has.

952
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,219
God, l feel like singing.

953
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:10,514
That would be very nice.

954
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:13,559
No, l really feel like singing a song.

955
01:24:16,798 --> 01:24:20,495
- Leland?
- Come on, everybody. Get happy.

956
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:23,229
- ''Get Happy.''
- ''Get Happy''?

957
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:30,075
Forget your troubIes
And just get happy

958
01:24:30,245 --> 01:24:32,406
You gotta pack aII your cares away

959
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:34,845
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

960
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,481
Get ready for the judgment day

961
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:39,916
The sun is shinin'
Come on, get happy

962
01:24:40,088 --> 01:24:42,215
The Lord is waitin' to take your hand

963
01:24:42,391 --> 01:24:44,859
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

964
01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:47,017
We're going to that promised Iand

965
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:51,894
We're headin' cross the river
Wash your sins away in the tide

966
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:56,663
It's, oh, so peacefuI on the other side

967
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:58,897
Forget your troubIes
Come on, get happy

968
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:01,406
You better chase aII your cares away

969
01:25:01,576 --> 01:25:03,510
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

970
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:05,236
Get ready for the judgment day

971
01:25:05,414 --> 01:25:07,006
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

972
01:25:07,182 --> 01:25:08,740
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

973
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,441
Get ready for the judgment day

974
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:12,246
Sing haIIeIujah
Come on, get happy

975
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:14,787
Get ready for the judgment d--

976
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:22,020
Donna, get my bag.

977
01:25:24,733 --> 01:25:26,530
Leland?

978
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:32,104
- Dad, is he okay?
- l'm sure it's nothing serious.

979
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:38,939
Oh, God.

980
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:40,805
l feel happy.

981
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:42,950
l feel happy.

982
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:45,143
''Begin the Beguine.''

983
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:54,953
Diane, it's 1 1 :55 p.m.,

984
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,655
approximately 1 9 hours
since the shooting incident

985
01:25:57,833 --> 01:26:00,131
which nearly caused me
to make a premature purchase

986
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:01,769
of the proverbial farm.

987
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,728
l'm dog-tired.

988
01:26:04,906 --> 01:26:09,240
A man can only go so long
without submitting to a period of rest.

989
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:10,969
For as we know from experiments

990
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:14,172
conducted on American Gls
during the Korean War,

991
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:18,843
sleep deprivation is a one-way ticket
to temporary psychosis.

992
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:21,921
And l'm working on a three-day jag.

993
01:26:22,858 --> 01:26:24,587
l got so goofy last night, Diane,

994
01:26:24,759 --> 01:26:27,853
lying here wondering
whether l was going to live or die,

995
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:32,090
that l thought l saw
a giant in my room.

996
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:35,668
Or perhaps that's a story
l'll save for another time.

997
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,539
This is me, Dale,

998
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:42,871
room 31 5 at The Great Northern Hotel,
signing off.

999
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:09,367
Special agent.

1000
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:14,100
Special agent. Special agent.

1001
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:20,372
Special agent, are you there?

1002
01:27:24,653 --> 01:27:26,917
l left you a note.
Didn't you get my note?

1003
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:31,686
l slipped it under your door.
You must have seen it.

1004
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:43,095
Well, l'm up here
at One-Eyed Jack's.

1005
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:48,073
To be perfectly honest,
l think l'm in a little over my head.

1006
01:27:51,846 --> 01:27:54,280
Not that l can't handle it.

1007
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,051
l mean, if l'm gonna help you out
with your investigations,

1008
01:27:58,219 --> 01:28:01,120
l'm sure l'll be put into situations
a lot more dangerous than this

1009
01:28:01,289 --> 01:28:03,723
on a fairly regular basis.

1010
01:28:05,594 --> 01:28:07,562
But it's just...

1011
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:12,192
...you know, my first time out.

1012
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:15,427
l could use a little expert guidance.

1013
01:28:19,808 --> 01:28:21,435
So you know,
there is a connection

1014
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,101
between Horne's Department Store
and One-Eyed Jack's.

1015
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:27,305
lt's my father, he owns the place.

1016
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:30,451
Little ball of sleaze named Battis
helps to recruit some of the girls

1017
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:33,417
from the perfume counter.

1018
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:37,490
Tomorrow l'm gonna try to find out
if Laura and Ronette came up here.

1019
01:28:44,232 --> 01:28:48,066
l hope you won't think any less of me
for trying to help you.

1020
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:53,335
You know, l promise l only did it
with the best of intentions.

1021
01:28:54,442 --> 01:28:56,842
And if there's any way...

1022
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:02,306
lf there's any way in the world
that you can hear me right now,

1023
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:05,282
please help me.

1024
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:08,951
Help me. Help me.

1025
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:56,064
Sorry to wake you.

1026
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:01,299
l am not dreaming.

1027
01:30:01,876 --> 01:30:04,208
l forgot to tell you something.

1028
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,607
You were right
about the smiling bag.

1029
01:30:09,584 --> 01:30:13,486
The things l tell you
will not be wrong.

1030
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:19,383
Better to listen than to talk.

1031
01:30:20,829 --> 01:30:22,421
l believe you.

1032
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:25,896
Don't search
for all the answers at once.

1033
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:32,103
A path is formed
by laying one stone at a time.

1034
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:40,541
One person saw the third man.

1035
01:30:40,715 --> 01:30:44,845
Three have seen him, yes,

1036
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:46,919
but not his body.

1037
01:30:47,088 --> 01:30:51,252
One only known to you.

1038
01:30:51,426 --> 01:30:53,519
Ready now to talk.

1039
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:59,292
One more thing.

1040
01:30:59,467 --> 01:31:02,163
You forgot something.

1041
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:05,731
What?

1042
01:32:11,206 --> 01:32:13,299
Laura! Laura!

1043
01:32:28,723 --> 01:32:31,283
Laura!
