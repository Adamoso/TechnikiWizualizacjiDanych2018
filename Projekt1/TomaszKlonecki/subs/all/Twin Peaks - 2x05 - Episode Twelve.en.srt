1
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:02,433
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,394
Rough sleep.

3
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,403
l had dreamt l was eating a large,
tasteless gumdrop.

4
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,942
l awoke to realize
that l was aggressively munching

5
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,081
on one of my Air-Pillow
silicone earplugs.

6
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,615
Hence the tastelessness.

7
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,680
Perhaps l should keep a closer eye
on my after-dinner coffee consumption.

8
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:29,691
Persistent soreness in the rib area,

9
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,832
which l'm treating each morning with
1 5 extra minutes of yogic discipline.

10
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:39,095
After which, thankfully,
the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac

11
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:42,605
in a distant suburb
of my conscious mind.

12
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,805
l'm going to begin today
with a headstand.

13
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,352
Diane, l am now upside down.

14
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:05,028
Mind becoming porous.

15
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:11,501
The day's tasks coming into focus.
Objects growing clearer.

16
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:31,146
Diane, the Giant was right.
l did forget something.

17
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,890
Hey. Thought we'd lost you
to the Kalispell woods.

18
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,186
Two retired female schoolteachers
live in that house next to the Palmers.

19
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,989
They have no memory
of a gray-haired man.

20
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:14,360
l had to drink three pots
of chamomile tea to find that out.

21
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,059
Which reminds me.
Would you excuse me for a minute?

22
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,532
- Sure.
- Thanks.

23
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,298
Keep looking for the one-armed man.
We gotta find him.

24
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:24,033
Excuse me, sheriff,
l just wanted to say goodbye

25
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,372
because, as you know,
l'm going down to Tacoma for two days

26
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,516
to visit my sister Gwen
and her husband, Larry,

27
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,015
who had a baby last week.

28
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:35,016
- Right.
- That is, Gwen had the baby.

29
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,748
Larry's the father.
You remember? lt was a boy.

30
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,190
Well, anyway, as soon as
the Can-Do temp girl gets here,

31
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,091
l'll explain the phones
and the coffee and the intercom--

32
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,924
- Lucy, it's okay.
- And the wag--

33
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,862
We got it covered.

34
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,461
No, she should've
been here by now.

35
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:56,972
- l can stay and at least show her--
- Lucy, don't worry. Just go.

36
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:00,937
Sometimes the Can-Do girls can't.

37
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,551
- But, sheriff--
- We got it covered.

38
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:10,882
Have a safe trip, Lucy.

39
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,091
Thank you.

40
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,352
- Morning, Coop.
- Harry.

41
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,291
What is the word
on our delivery tonight?

42
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,228
We won't need it.
We've got the jump on them.

43
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,931
l know where Audrey is.

44
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,939
You see, the Port-O-Patient
will allow you to fluently transport

45
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,940
the unfortunate Mr. Johnson,

46
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:35,774
allowing him to even go outside,

47
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:40,009
and sit and experience
what he can of nature.

48
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,118
Mr. Pinkle, l want my cousin Leo

49
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,882
to have the fullest possible
experience of life.

50
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:50,188
Well, that's what we're here for.
Okay, let's give it one more.

51
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,523
Mr. Pinkle,
are you gonna install the ramp?

52
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,033
Well, sure, of course, of course.

53
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,863
As a matter of fact,
l already have some--

54
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,199
Some plywood ramp--

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,001
Pinewood ramp boards
that l'll install tomorrow. Absolutely.

56
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,840
That's a very good suggestion.
Now, l think we are ready to go.

57
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,643
Finally. There we go. All right?

58
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,787
That's a new wrinkle.

59
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,789
l can't believe it. lt was working
just so perfectly yesterday.

60
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,188
Come on. Come on--

61
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,956
You gotta be tough with this thing.
You gotta hit it hard.

62
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:29,192
A machine is like a woman, we always
say at the machine shop. Come on.

63
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:34,665
Oh, Bobby, are you okay?

64
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,669
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle
a cold drink, please?

65
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,971
A diet soda, please.
That would be great.

66
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,206
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle.

67
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,544
This thing is a death trap.
l told you we have to keep him alive.

68
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:49,654
The insurance companies
don't exactly pay off like the slots.

69
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,016
After we take our cuts,

70
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:54,490
we had only money for this
or a first-rate wheelbarrow.

71
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh, thank you very much.

72
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,190
Oh, thanks a lot.

73
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:03,166
Bobby?

74
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:12,070
- l've gotta meet Leo's lawyer.
- The hearing's today, right?

75
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:15,372
Be just another second, folks.

76
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,010
Bobby...

77
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,411
...are we okay?

78
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,863
Oh, that's it.
Come and take a look. You can see it.

79
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,365
lt works just fine.

80
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,572
Come outside with me.

81
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,138
He can let himself out.

82
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:49,508
Bobby, we're doing real good.
Okay, that's enough.

83
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:54,818
Bobby?

84
00:07:56,256 --> 00:08:00,283
Bob, Bob, l can't reach the switch.
Bobby, l've got a problem here.

85
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:15,304
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty

86
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,943
to the charge
of murder in the first degree.

87
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,612
The defense has requested bail.

88
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:25,979
This pre-trial hearing is to determine
whether that bail will be granted.

89
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,621
Mr. Prosecutor.

90
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:31,180
We, the people
of the State of Washington,

91
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:34,451
move the defendant be denied bail.

92
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,424
On the basis of one,

93
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:39,860
the great seriousness of the crime
for which he has been accused.

94
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,559
Two, the apparently
premeditated nature of this act.

95
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:49,174
And three, the oft-witnessed
instability of Mr. Palmer

96
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,641
during the period
following the death of his daughter.

97
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:57,672
Sheriff Truman will speak
for the defense.

98
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,180
Your Honor,

99
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:06,323
Leland Palmer
is a well-known, well-liked,

100
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,885
well-respected member
of this community.

101
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,960
His roots go way back.

102
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,360
His grandfather, Joshua Palmer,

103
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,692
brought the family here
more than 75 years ago.

104
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:21,340
Your Honor, no one can know

105
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,474
what it's like to lose a daughter
the way Leland did.

106
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:29,877
That's all.

107
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,746
Thank you, sheriff.

108
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,684
Mr. Lodwick, would you care...?

109
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,483
l thought l might sell this
to the Gazette.

110
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,752
They seem to like
courtroom sketches.

111
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:47,856
Yeah, why don't you try
for a little more face than that?

112
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:52,766
--high standing in the community,
and the pristine nature of his public...

113
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,236
Just an idea.

114
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,031
Good. Thanks, sheriff.

115
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:01,373
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

116
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,938
Now, Leland,

117
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:09,680
as you know,
l will require you to remain in town

118
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:14,084
and making your whereabouts
known to the sheriff

119
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,160
on a regular basis.

120
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,192
Sid, check the calendar,

121
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:23,028
and we'll set a date
for Mr. Palmer's trial

122
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:26,231
as soon as possible.

123
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:44,416
- Hi.
- Hi.

124
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,816
Thank you.

125
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:58,966
So, what's behind those
deep blue eyes today?

126
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,698
l've got a proposition for you.

127
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,007
l'll share my life with you.
l'll tell it to you.

128
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,441
Part of your living novel...

129
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:11,481
...if you let me read Laura's diary.

130
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,355
lt's intriguing.

131
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,855
l'll read it to you.

132
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,759
But it mustn't physically
leave this room.

133
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,134
Acceptable.

134
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,646
- You'll start?
- Of course.

135
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:51,317
A bargain has been struck.

136
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,426
Donna Hayward.

137
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,438
- Begin.
- All right.

138
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,509
l'm from Twin Peaks.
Actually, l was born here.

139
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,914
My father delivered me.
He's a doctor.

140
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,819
Where are you from?

141
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,582
l grew up in Boston.

142
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,754
Well, actually, l grew up in books.

143
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:14,135
There's things
you can't get in books.

144
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,605
There are things
you can't get anywhere.

145
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:24,583
But we dream
they can be found in other people.

146
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,646
Continue.

147
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,590
Maybe our dreams are real.

148
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,062
My turn.

149
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,097
What are you doing?

150
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,761
Maybe l'll read it out here
on the lawn.

151
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,738
Please.

152
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,076
We've only just started.

153
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,770
Why don't you come with me?

154
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,610
Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?

155
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,742
Come on.

156
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:05,750
Please?

157
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,194
Give that back to me.

158
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,965
Harold?

159
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,497
Harold?

160
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,772
l'm sorry.

161
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:30,614
l'm sorry.

162
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:41,016
The defense will continue
with its evidence.

163
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,821
lf you would, Mr. Racine.

164
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,623
You can see from these EEGs,

165
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:48,198
this chart here,
which is actually of my own head,

166
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,198
is intended to show
normal brain activity.

167
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,804
Objection to the use
of the word ''normal,'' Your Honor.

168
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,531
Well, he's close enough.

169
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,139
Objection overruled.

170
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:06,178
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson
and shows minimal activity.

171
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,422
A previously submitted
medical report

172
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:17,893
states that Mr. Johnson
has suffered diffuse brain damage.

173
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,827
He doesn't currently
even have the perspicacity

174
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,833
to take the standard CST
competency test.

175
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,038
We therefore submit

176
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,607
that trying this individual

177
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,878
would constitute a mockery
of the justice system.

178
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,738
A proceeding that
the unfortunate young man

179
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,612
would not even faintly comprehend.

180
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,384
Mr. Prosecutor.

181
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,730
l know Leo Johnson
isn't in very good shape.

182
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:56,732
On the surface, it might seem
ridiculous to make him stand trial.

183
00:15:56,902 --> 00:16:00,770
But the trial does more
than just punish the wrongdoer.

184
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,274
lt also brings a feeling of justice
and retribution to a community.

185
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,641
Among the various crimes
Leo Johnson is suspected of,

186
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:14,444
the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort
that can wound an entire town.

187
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,248
As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath,

188
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,914
- All right.
- he is as eminently deserving of a trial

189
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,617
as this community is
of a sense of resolution!

190
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,660
All right.

191
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,965
Now, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick.

192
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,605
Now, you fellas
can catch your breath.

193
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:39,032
l am going to need to deliberate.

194
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,574
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman,

195
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,445
if l could have the pleasure
of your company.

196
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:52,849
Sid, can you fix us up with three
black Yukon sucker punches?

197
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,821
Yes, Your Honor.

198
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:59,930
Lodwick really planted his feet
and looked it in the eye.

199
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:04,035
l didn't expect him to press
on the murder charge.

200
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,604
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?

201
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,003
No, sir. l don't believe he is.

202
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:14,203
Harry, what's the temperature
of the town?

203
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,611
Do they want a trial or a lynching?

204
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,684
They want the right man
brought to justice.

205
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:23,219
Well, they don't need a circus.

206
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:25,823
And this poor bastard,

207
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:28,221
he seems to be a heady cabbage.

208
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,561
Thoughts, Cooper?

209
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,291
l feel the killer
will eventually be apprehended.

210
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:40,094
You have to watch these.
They sneak up on you.

211
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:56,185
l'm gonna declare Leo Johnson

212
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,654
to be not competent to stand trial.

213
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,386
And when medically possible,
that he be shipped home.

214
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:11,699
Harry, do you wanna tell
the little lady yourself?

215
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,535
Thanks, Clinton.

216
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,835
- Cooper, how long you been here?
- Twelve days, sir.

217
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,645
- They're not gonna try him.
- No?

218
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,382
Leo is coming home.

219
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,520
l'll advise you to keep your eye
on the woods.

220
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,761
The woods are wondrous here...

221
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,057
...but strange.

222
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,293
Thanks.

223
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:02,251
Can l get you anything, Nadine?

224
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:07,047
- Who are you?
- Who am l?

225
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:13,922
- You go to the high school.
- Well, yeah.

226
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,397
Yeah, it took me a second.
You're not in any of my classes.

227
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,062
Why don't you sit down, honey?
Let me get you a drink.

228
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,105
Oh, no, l'll get it.

229
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,636
Where are Mom and Dad?

230
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:31,240
Oh, out of town.

231
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,809
Okay.

232
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,749
You're a jack and I'm a jack
And SteepIejacks are we

233
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,088
Doc Hayward said
to roll with the punches.

234
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:48,328
Have you thought about maybe
taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?

235
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:52,334
No, he's in Hawaii
recovering from that heart attack.

236
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:01,139
lt just came right off.

237
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:21,758
- Mr. Tojamura is here.
- Mister who?

238
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,699
Excuse me.

239
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:33,570
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Tojamura.

240
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:39,283
l represent Asian investment bank.

241
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,651
We have superior offer

242
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:47,155
for Ghostwood Project.

243
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,492
l have commitment letters
from Tokyo banks

244
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,657
prepared to move immediately.

245
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,502
This all sounds very interesting,

246
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:02,698
but unfortunately, l have an important
conference call in a couple of minutes.

247
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,569
l have prospectus...

248
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:10,075
- Perhaps some other time.
- ...and taste.

249
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,186
Five.

250
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,753
Million?

251
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,448
l would like you to leave these.
Let my people have a look at them.

252
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,952
Point of visit.

253
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:08,640
Cooper's on his way.

254
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,511
Your caII from Canada, Mr. Horne.

255
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:17,311
- ls that our call?
- Yes.

256
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,781
You pushed it pretty close.

257
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,518
- Benjamin Horne.
- Are you ready to pIay?

258
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:31,426
Audrey.

259
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,832
- l wanna talk to my daughter.
- That can wait for tonight.

260
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,367
One time. Across the border,

261
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:41,995
five miIes east of Grand Forks,
on the road to CastIegar,

262
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,699
is a bar caIIed the CoIumbian.

263
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,538
Behind it
is a faiIed amusement park.

264
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:49,647
Go to the merry-go-round.

265
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:53,012
Leave the briefcase
beside the horse with no head,

266
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,949
at midnight, aIone.

267
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,952
l'll be sending my representative.

268
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:12,201
Serialized denominations,
as you instructed.

269
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,467
My daughter's life is in your hands.

270
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,055
Stay by a phone.

271
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,431
Follow him.

272
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,194
Make sure that he and the money
are neatly delivered.

273
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,567
- Bring Audrey back.
- Cooper's not bringing her back?

274
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:51,836
Cooper isn't coming back.

275
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:53,940
lf you can manage it,

276
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,072
bring back Audrey
and the briefcase.

277
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,925
Five million dollars.

278
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,057
Now, that's a good day's work.

279
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,865
All right,
once you're in Harold's apartment,

280
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,406
move as fast as you can.

281
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,407
This is scary.

282
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:30,446
Laura's diary is in a secret shelf
at the very bottom of the bookcase,

283
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,583
behind a row of fake books.

284
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,152
Now, l think that there's a doohickey
on the right-hand side

285
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:39,950
that somehow lets the shelf
slide out and down.

286
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,457
All the notebooks look the same,
except for Laura's.

287
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:44,960
Hers is smaller with a red cover.

288
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,155
How are you gonna get him
to go outside?

289
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,924
Not outside,
just out of the front room.

290
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,661
Then l'll signal you with the flashlight
through the window.

291
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,634
The door will be open.

292
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,070
l thought you liked this guy.

293
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,601
l do.

294
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,046
Okay.

295
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:14,458
Cooper hands me the briefcase.

296
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:15,923
l take it...

297
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,330
What about Ben Horne?

298
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:27,836
Well, he give up control
of One-Eyed Jack's.

299
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,701
lt's yours.

300
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,275
With his daughter dead?

301
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:35,612
You know, you love a good steak

302
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,875
but you don't want to know
how it got on your plate.

303
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:42,884
You must be serious about
your business, Blackie.

304
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,650
How are you gonna do the girl?

305
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,455
Voila.

306
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,506
- Does the girl sleep?
- Dreamland.

307
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:11,141
Come, come, come. Come to me.

308
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:18,555
ln the other room,
the girl dreams of fishes

309
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,557
and dark lakebeds
and tangle weeds.

310
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,328
What about Blackie?

311
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:28,389
- l've waited long enough.
- We have our fun tonight.

312
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,397
Kiss me.

313
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,838
Right. Okay. Bye.

314
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:57,294
- Laboratory Services.
- Yeah, l'm calling for some test results.

315
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,623
Doc Hayward said
l could just call you up and--

316
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,733
- Yes, what test was it for, sir?
- What's it for?

317
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,198
Yes, pIease, sir.

318
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:11,138
lt was for a semen's analysis.
Brennan, Andy.

319
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,872
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you, sir.
- Sorry. Brennan, Andy.

320
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:19,779
Oh, the doctor's anaIysis
is oIigospermia, sir.

321
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:23,547
Yes, could you go slower.
l wanna write all this down.

322
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:29,957
- OIigospermia.
- ''Oligospermia.''

323
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:33,097
- That's right.
- That sounds terrible.

324
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,893
- l have that?
- No, sir. You had that.

325
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:38,127
Oh, l had it.

326
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:44,071
- It means too few sperms.
- ''Too few sperms.''

327
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,210
Very good, sir.

328
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:47,943
You mean l'm cured?

329
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,274
The doctor says
they're not just three men on a--

330
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:55,113
''Doc says they're not just
three men on a fishing trip,

331
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:57,687
- They're a whoIe damn town.
- they're a whole damn town.''

332
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:00,916
- That's right, sir. Do you understand?
- Yeah, l know what it means.

333
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:03,084
lt means they're not really real
people, they're--

334
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:06,526
- I'm sorry, sir, I've got another caII.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

335
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:09,326
- You're weIcome, sir.
- Thank you very much.

336
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:13,662
l'm a whole damn town!

337
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:17,537
l'm a whole damn town.

338
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:25,309
Don't ask.

339
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,009
Where were we?

340
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:31,314
Okay, main bar
and greeting room here.

341
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,390
Casino and get-acquainted room.

342
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:38,258
- What's this, Blackie's office?
- We'll find out when we get there.

343
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:45,630
The one-armed man is staying in
the Robin's Nest Motel on Highway 9.

344
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:48,773
Nobody's seen him for at least
a day, a day and a half.

345
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,534
The room looks lived-in.

346
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:53,804
l found this.

347
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,345
Same drug as last time.

348
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,410
A weird, deep smell.

349
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:02,854
We're still waiting on Albert's analysis.
Good work, Hawk.

350
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,358
Hawk, see you in the morning.

351
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:22,429
Okay.

352
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,601
We'll approach through the woods
to the rear door.

353
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:29,110
lnside are stairs leading down
to the working rooms.

354
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:32,376
My guess is,
that's where Audrey's being held.

355
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,780
What kind of muscle do they have?

356
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:39,913
A couple of floor men in the casino,
probably more in the back.

357
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,190
Let's go get her.

358
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:52,596
- Good night, Andy.
- See you in the morning, Andy.

359
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,466
Good work.

360
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,777
''Gwen and Larry.''

361
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:15,454
- Adam's Abortion CIinic.
- Hi, is Lucy--? What?

362
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,857
Adam's Abortion CIinic.

363
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:23,600
Oh, my God.

364
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:34,768
Can l get a cup of coffee to go?

365
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:38,109
- Hi.
- Hi.

366
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,251
Large, please.

367
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,186
- So you seen Donna today?
- No, sorry.

368
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:46,118
- You?
- No.

369
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:49,192
- So, what's with the coffee?
- Coffee?

370
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:51,794
lt's for Uncle Leland.

371
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,661
You don't have coffee at home?

372
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,659
James, l can't talk now.

373
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:01,328
- l need to go.
- You need to go?

374
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,907
- Where are you going?
- Home. Bye, James.

375
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,807
Donna Hayward.

376
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:43,206
March 7th, Tuesday.
Second session.

377
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,514
Dear diary...

378
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:51,045
This is from a long time ago.
ls that okay?

379
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:59,858
l was about 1 3 years old, 1 4 maybe.

380
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:06,961
Me and Laura put on our tightest,
shortest skirts. Too tight.

381
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,901
But Laura talked me into it.

382
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,607
We were going to the Roadhouse
to meet boys.

383
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,913
Their names are

384
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:25,356
Josh, Rick and Tim.

385
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,486
They're about 20 years old.

386
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:35,225
And they're nice to us.

387
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,213
And they make us feel
like we're older.

388
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:56,382
Rick asks if we wanna go party.

389
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,019
And Laura says, yes.

390
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:04,459
And all of a sudden, l feel this knot
building up in my stomach.

391
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:09,032
But when Laura gets in the truck
with Rick, l go anyway.

392
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,167
Stream in the woods.

393
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,970
Full moon, l think.

394
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,803
lt's pale and light out.

395
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:26,544
Laura starts to dance
around the boys.

396
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,422
She begins to move her hips...

397
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:39,553
...back and forth.

398
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:47,434
Rick starts to clap, but Tim doesn't
do anything, he just watches.

399
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,875
Somehow, that makes me angry.

400
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,675
So l say, ''Let's go skinny-dipping.''

401
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,520
We take off our clothes.

402
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,620
l know the boys are watching.

403
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:11,362
Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick.

404
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,822
l don't know what to do.

405
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,396
So l swim away.

406
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:23,469
l feel like l wanna run, but l don't.

407
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:29,245
Tim swims out to me.

408
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,745
He kisses my hand...

409
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,818
...and then me.

410
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,760
l can still feel that kiss.

411
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:55,365
His lips are warm and sweet.

412
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,370
My heart jumps.

413
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:05,348
He's talking to me,
but l can't hear him.

414
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:10,180
Only the kiss.

415
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,653
l never saw him again.

416
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,890
lt was the first time l ever fell in love.

417
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:30,107
That's all.

418
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,674
That was beautiful, Donna.

419
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,506
l got him.

420
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:21,583
Harry.

421
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,916
Wait here, Harry.

422
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,095
No. Dead end.

423
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,909
- Two.
- Audrey?

424
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,396
Not such a bad way to go,
all things considered.

425
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,365
No, no. lt's beautiful.

426
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,472
- ls she alone?
- Nancy's with her.

427
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:53,405
What does she do for you l can't?

428
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:57,110
Well, something new.

429
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:19,292
Most people imagine orchids
growing in exotic, steamy places.

430
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,960
But you can grow them anywhere.

431
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:24,207
lt's all basically a matter
of water and light, isn't it?

432
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,275
lt's beautiful.

433
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:29,845
Here, look.

434
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:37,551
See, humidity is paramount.
Well, the control of it, l mean.

435
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:41,225
Too much moisture
is an invitation to disease.

436
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,695
Three sepals and three petals.

437
00:39:44,862 --> 00:39:48,389
The bottom petal,
shaped like a lower lip,

438
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,830
is called a labellum.

439
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,533
So delicate.

440
00:39:55,673 --> 00:40:01,509
Well, it's the landing platform,
really, for pollinating insects.

441
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:04,444
Romantic, isn't it?

442
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,239
Will you excuse me a minute?

443
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:15,919
Hi.

444
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,756
Would you take me
to Audrey Horne, please?

445
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,619
- l don't think she's available.
- Let's double-check.

446
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:46,579
lt's not my idea, okay?

447
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,484
You're nothing but meat on a hook
to these people.

448
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,246
Shut up.

449
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,425
Audrey, can you hear me?

450
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:07,501
My prayers.

451
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:11,439
Audrey, l'm gonna take you
out of here now.

452
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,193
No.

453
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:38,461
When you leave me with a kiss.

454
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:42,836
That's the way you want it,
that's fine.

455
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:26,778
Drop the gun.

456
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:29,780
Slowly.

457
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:36,284
Now, turn around.

458
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,405
Good thing you guys
can't keep a secret.

459
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,078
Good throw.

460
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,624
There's been gunfire.

461
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,595
Truman and Cooper are leaving
with your daughter.

462
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:21,828
Now, who can this be?

463
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,132
Monsieur Lodwick. DA's office, eh?

464
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:45,354
- ls something wrong?
- No.

465
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:47,258
You just frightened me, that's all.

466
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:56,235
Come here.

467
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,340
Tell me about this orchid. This one.

468
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:17,794
Harold, no, you don't understand.

469
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,028
Maddy!

470
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:29,029
Wait!

471
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:35,307
Are you looking for secrets?

472
00:45:37,648 --> 00:45:40,082
ls that what all this is about?

473
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:44,583
Well, maybe l can help you.

474
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:49,854
Do you know
what the ultimate secret is?

475
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:51,858
You want to know?

476
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,527
Laura did.

477
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:03,864
The secret of knowing who killed you.
