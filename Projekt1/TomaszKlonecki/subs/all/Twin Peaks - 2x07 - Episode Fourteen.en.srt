1
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:39,837
Everything's set. They're waiting for us
at the Great Northern.

2
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:46,577
Yeah, a large house made of wood,
surrounded by trees.

3
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:51,281
The house is filled with many rooms
each alike,

4
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:57,761
but occupied by different souls
night after night.

5
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:03,465
- The guests will be in the lobby?
- Full cooperation.

6
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:07,366
Hawk, you got that warrant
for Harold Smith's apartment?

7
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,372
On my way
as soon as l finish my coffee.

8
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,307
Hawk, Gordon has mentioned
pages--

9
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:16,573
What l mentioned were pages
found near the bloody towel

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,809
down the train tracks
from the crime site

11
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,317
were from a diary.

12
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,489
Donna Hayward
spoke of Harold Smith

13
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,250
having a secret diary
of Laura Palmer's.

14
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,987
Could be important.
Let me know what you dig up.

15
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,458
Gordon, l understand you're--?

16
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,896
Gordon, l understand
you're on your way to Bend, Oregon?

17
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,698
l'm over to Bend, Oregon,
official business, real hush-hush.

18
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:42,136
Good luck to all of you.

19
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,638
- Coop.
- Gordon.

20
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,512
Take good care of Mike.

21
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:56,747
lt was real nice meeting you fellas.

22
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,019
- Sheriff.
- Safe journey, chief.

23
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,750
Thanks.

24
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,139
No.

25
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,679
No.

26
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:28,384
No.

27
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,300
No.

28
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,043
No.

29
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,654
No.

30
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,728
Sheriff? Sheriff!

31
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:20,703
Sheriff, what's the meaning of this?
What the hell is going on here?

32
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:28,943
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is happening here?

33
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,514
What in the hell is going on?

34
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,112
Mr. Smith.

35
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,473
Harold Smith?

36
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,620
Morning.

37
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,951
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Maddy.

38
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,960
Uncle Leland.

39
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,697
Aunt Sarah.

40
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:30,826
Sit. Oh, good, you got some coffee.
Good.

41
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:35,998
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well. Thanks.

42
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:41,571
l've been thinking.

43
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:46,018
l've really enjoyed my stay
and everything.

44
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,651
But l really feel like it's time
for me to go home now.

45
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,027
To Missoula.

46
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:02,395
l've got my job and my apartment.

47
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,593
And l just...

48
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:09,374
...miss having a life of my own.

49
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:16,913
So l think l'll probably be driving
back home tomorrow.

50
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,107
Tomorrow?

51
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:23,221
Well, we are going to miss you
very much.

52
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:27,283
- But we also understand completely.
- You do?

53
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,360
- We do.
- We do. Yes, we do.

54
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,233
You have been
such a wonderful help.

55
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:40,964
Yes, but now she has to think
about herself, honey.

56
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,268
She's got her own life.

57
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,107
Besides, you'll come back and visit,
won't you?

58
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,270
Oh, of course.

59
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:51,781
l'll come galloping back often.

60
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,818
lt's not like Missoula
was at the far end of the universe.

61
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:56,454
- No.
- Hardly.

62
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,716
Well, good then.

63
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,825
lt's all right.

64
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,095
Just know that we love you
very much.

65
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,899
l love you too.

66
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,659
- Hey, what's that, a note?
- Yeah.

67
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,337
''l'm a lonely soul.''

68
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,770
Poor guy.

69
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,040
lt's a good thing
Andy didn't see this one.

70
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,010
Oh, yeah.

71
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:00,813
Take a look at this.

72
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,729
''This is the diary of Laura Palmer.''

73
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,230
Pay dirt.

74
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:41,857
Well, we have bills here
that total $1 ,01 4.

75
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,861
lncluding the insurance money

76
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,999
that leaves you with...

77
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,567
Forty-two dollars.

78
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,335
- Forty-two dollars.
- That's a good start.

79
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:59,772
Forty-two dollars for the month?

80
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,146
How am l gonna make it?

81
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:05,146
How are we supposed to survive
on $42 a month?

82
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:09,015
We? Shelly, l can't keep telling
my mom and dad

83
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:11,156
that l'm spending the night
at Mike's.

84
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:13,416
What time is it?
l'm missing Economics as it is.

85
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,720
''We'' meant me and Leo.

86
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,863
Bobby, you said
you were gonna take care of us.

87
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,194
l am, Shelly. l am.

88
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,532
l want you
to take the necklace back.

89
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,739
We don't have to do that.

90
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,875
l want you to take the necklace back.
We need the money.

91
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,076
Shelly, you're gonna
keep this necklace.

92
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,381
When am l ever gonna feel
glamorous enough to wear it?

93
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,219
Giving Leo a bath?
Feeding him his oatmeal?

94
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,629
What about his truck?

95
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,325
He's not gonna be cannonballing
down the highway anytime soon.

96
00:10:56,502 --> 00:11:00,131
- The police impounded it.
- We can get it back.

97
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,501
They said if it was used
in the commission of a crime

98
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,269
it becomes property of the state.

99
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:09,447
- He wasn't charged with anything.
- l didn't make the rules.

100
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,446
Okay, okay.

101
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,278
lt's like you're blaming me
for something.

102
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:17,480
l'm not blaming you. Come on.
Take it easy.

103
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:23,288
Leo was into a lot of different stuff
with a lot of different people.

104
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,731
He was in it for the money.

105
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,869
Bobby, look around you.
You really think that Leo had money?

106
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,162
Yes, l do.
Having a look at this checkbook,

107
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,366
l don't think he ever stepped foot
into a bank.

108
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,544
He must have been hiding it
somewhere.

109
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:46,941
He's alive.

110
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:50,755
New shoes.

111
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,855
Bobby, he's alive.

112
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:17,177
- He ain't alive, Shelly.
- But he talked.

113
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:20,409
lt's only-- That was a burp.
He probably has gas.

114
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,416
You call that a burp?

115
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:27,092
New shoes.

116
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,365
Did he buy any shoes lately
by any chance?

117
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,897
No.

118
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,298
He had me take in a pair of boots
for repair.

119
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,905
- When?
- Last week.

120
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,441
- Have you got a receipt?
- Yeah, why?

121
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:52,617
l don't know.
Shelly, go get that receipt.

122
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,684
New shoes.

123
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,025
Want some new shoes, Leo?

124
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:08,632
Give us what we want,
l'll buy you the whole damn shoe store.

125
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,839
New shoes.

126
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:25,278
Daddy, l know about
One-Eyed Jack's.

127
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:31,885
l'm sure l don't know
what you're talking about.

128
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:35,118
l know about Blackie,
l know about Emory Battis,

129
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,956
l know about Ronette,
and l know about Laura.

130
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,933
Okay.

131
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,971
l was there. l saw you.

132
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,677
You remember Prudence?

133
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:58,178
l wore a little white mask.

134
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:11,130
l need to ask you some questions.

135
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,665
Ask away.

136
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,698
How long have you owned
One-Eyed Jack's?

137
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,942
Five years.

138
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:29,780
Did you know Laura worked there?

139
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,281
She was only there for a brief time.

140
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:34,612
- Did you know?
- Yes.

141
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:37,549
Did you in any way encourage her
to work there?

142
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:41,523
No. l had no idea.

143
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,326
She asked if she could work
in the department store.

144
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:47,125
Battis sent her without my knowing.

145
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:53,232
Did you sleep with her?

146
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,512
Did you?

147
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,256
Yes.

148
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,500
Did you kill her?

149
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:43,985
l loved her.

150
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:13,074
Norma, can l talk to you
for a second?

151
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,620
Sure. What's up?

152
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,594
With Leo coming home and all...

153
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,926
...l'm supposed to be there
to watch him.

154
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:30,330
And it looks like
it's gonna be a full-time thing.

155
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:37,332
So l was thinking

156
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:40,171
that l have to quit my job.

157
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,647
Just for a little while anyway.

158
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,849
l'm sorry.

159
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,986
l promised myself
l wasn't gonna do this.

160
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,124
lt's all right, sweetheart.

161
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,991
l just feel so bad.

162
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:09,871
l love you. l love working here.

163
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,301
l don't wanna let you down.

164
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,114
You're not gonna let me down.

165
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,317
l'm not?

166
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,148
Look, Shelly, you've got your own life
to worry about.

167
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,490
l'll be fine here.

168
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:32,495
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

169
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,166
Now, you look after yourself.

170
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,901
When you're ready,
you can come right back.

171
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:42,301
lt'll be like you haven't even
missed a day.

172
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,872
You'll let me come back?

173
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:50,675
You just try to take a job someplace
else and see what happens.

174
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,653
l don't know what to say.

175
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,626
Don't say anything.

176
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,943
And l told him l'd been traveling
with my parents,

177
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,546
but now l wanted to register
for spring semester.

178
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,549
Oh, Eddie, let's sit at the counter.

179
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,518
l'm just dying for a chocolate shake,
aren't you?

180
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,414
Hi, Norma.

181
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:38,052
Say, how long have you
been working here?

182
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,396
Well, it's 20 years this April.

183
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:46,769
Oh, you kidder.

184
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,203
What a kidder.

185
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:54,606
Well, it's been about six weeks,
isn't that right, Norma?

186
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,978
About six weeks.

187
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:03,279
- Oh, yeah, that's right.
- Well, you see?

188
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,322
When your parents drag you off
to Europe or someplace for a month,

189
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:11,793
then, when you get back,
it's like you've been away forever.

190
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,101
Two chocolate shakes,
please, Norma.

191
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,270
- Coffee for me.
- Extra whipped cream on mine.

192
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,772
Hi.

193
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:29,077
- What's your name?
- Shelly.

194
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,278
Are you in our class at school?

195
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,084
l don't think so.

196
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,728
l'll get the shake and coffee.

197
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:53,271
- Europe?
- Yeah.

198
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,036
My parents loved it so much
they're still there.

199
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,301
Can you believe it?

200
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:03,175
And they said it was okay
for me to stay over at Eddie's.

201
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:07,285
ls it your parents' house
or mine, Eddie?

202
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:08,852
That's right.

203
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:15,290
Oh, say, Norma,
you're not mad or anything

204
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:20,522
because Eddie's sort of taking me out,
are you?

205
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:25,033
You and Ed? No. No.
Why should l be?

206
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:29,071
Oh, no reason.
Eddie told me you broke up.

207
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,838
lt's just that...

208
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:36,779
...l'm just so sweet on him.

209
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:45,179
- lsn't he just the dreamiest?
- Nadine.

210
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:50,556
l can't wait
for the start of football season.

211
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:55,029
- Can you?
- No. Can't wait.

212
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,202
Me neither.

213
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,668
l am just so happy.

214
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,904
- Oh, Nadine.
- Oh, God, l'm sorry.

215
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,512
- How'd you do that?
- There goes another one.

216
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,338
There must've been a crack
in this glass from before.

217
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,042
- Golly.
- Don't count on it.

218
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:17,051
l'm so clumsy lately.

219
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:20,623
l can hardly believe it.

220
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,590
Shelly, get those Band-Aids,
and l'll get a towel.

221
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,399
Oh, Eddie.

222
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:35,095
l am so happy

223
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:41,337
l could just kiss you to death.

224
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,654
Oh, boy, Nadine.

225
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,975
l think she's at the diner. Shelly.

226
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,111
Shelly.

227
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,018
There he is, Mike.
The late Leo Johnson.

228
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,331
- Hank did this?
- He sure as hell did.

229
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,308
He shot him through that window
right there.

230
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:52,715
Leo, l went to the shoe shop.

231
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:57,288
l showed them the ticket,
and look what they gave me.

232
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:03,961
- New shoes.
- No, you knucklehead, old shoes.

233
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:06,688
Leo, he gets pretty fixated.

234
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,799
l hope he gets permanently fixated.

235
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:13,501
l know you too damn well, Leo.

236
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:17,642
Something about these shoes,
isn't there?

237
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,870
There's something
with these shoes.

238
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:28,878
l heard about people, you know,
muling stuff in their boot.

239
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,147
What, do you think
l didn't check these out?

240
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,257
Would you get a hammer?

241
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,985
Don't go anywhere, Leo.

242
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,775
Oh, my God.

243
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,525
- What is that, a tape?
- Don't.

244
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,897
Quit spitting, man.

245
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:21,297
Well, it's not money.

246
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,703
But who knows?

247
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,920
Diane, it's 2:4 7 p.m.

248
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,290
l'm in the conference room
at the sheriff's station

249
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,332
with the remains
of Laura Palmer's secret diary.

250
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,729
A great deal of it
has been mutilated.

251
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,598
Much of what l've been able
to decipher

252
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,104
supports the contention
of the one-armed man.

253
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,471
There are repeated references
to a Bob.

254
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,613
He was a threatening presence
in her life from early adolescence.

255
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:08,481
There are intimations of abuse
and molestation on a regular basis.

256
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:12,555
He is referred to,
on more than one occasion,

257
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:15,192
as a friend of her father's.

258
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:16,951
And l just uncovered this entry

259
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,927
dated less than two weeks
before her death:

260
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:24,663
''Someday l'm gonna tell the world
about Ben Horne.

261
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,271
l'm gonna tell them
who Ben Horne really is.''

262
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,268
Yes?

263
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,015
- Audrey.
- l had to see you.

264
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,345
- l'm sorry if l'm interrupting you.
- How are you feeling?

265
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:44,522
- l spoke with my father.
- Yeah?

266
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,848
He was sleeping with her.

267
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:50,051
With Laura.

268
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:53,528
l don't know for how long,
maybe quite a while.

269
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,134
Holy smokes.

270
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:59,168
She was up at One-Eyed Jack's,
working there.

271
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:02,306
And he owns the place,
that's what l found out.

272
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,476
- He told you this?
- Yes.

273
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,371
What are you gonna do?

274
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:12,043
Harry.

275
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:15,184
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna arrest him?

276
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,123
Audrey, l don't want you to say
a word about this to anyone.

277
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:25,688
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, go on home.

278
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:35,998
What's going on?

279
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,177
Without chemicals he points.

280
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,711
This morning at the Great Northern,
Mike reached for his arm and fainted

281
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:46,840
just when a certain person
walked into the room.

282
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,585
Harry, we need a warrant.

283
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:54,157
A warrant for the arrest
of Benjamin Horne.

284
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,599
Good news, Mr. Tojamura.

285
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:10,536
My brother, Jerry,
spoke to your people in Osaka,

286
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,210
checked your references
at the Tokyo bank,

287
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,438
and the answer to your proposal,
my good friend,

288
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:19,277
is a big thumbs up.

289
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:23,477
We appreciate your promptness.

290
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:26,589
Speaking for the entire community
of Twin Peaks,

291
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:29,226
l cannot tell you how pleased we are

292
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,795
to welcome you
into the Ghostwood fold.

293
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,297
Thank you so much.

294
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,733
- Contract. For your perusal.
- And a fast approval l--

295
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,068
Sheriff.

296
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,509
- What is this?
- This is police business.

297
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:51,273
We'd like you to come with us.

298
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,343
Fine. l happen to be in a meeting.

299
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,455
Could you be a little more specific?

300
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:04,588
You're wanted for questioning
in the murder of Laura Palmer.

301
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:07,094
ls that specific enough for you?

302
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:16,035
You're insane. lnsane.

303
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:18,708
Mr. Tojamura, l'm sure that this
is some dreadful mistake.

304
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,777
You can come quietly

305
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:23,847
or we can drag you through your lobby
in handcuffs.

306
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,951
Cooper, is this some sort
of sick joke?

307
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:31,054
Because if it is,
l know people in high places.

308
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:33,655
You'd better do what he says.

309
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,231
Go away.

310
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,563
Get out of here. Go on, go on.

311
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:47,635
l'm gonna go out for a sandwich.

312
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,342
No! No! No!

313
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:54,410
No! No!

314
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:58,810
No! No!

315
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,816
You--

316
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:07,018
No! You can't do this to me.

317
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:11,356
- lt's already done.
- You--

318
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:14,392
Leland.

319
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:43,816
Take him down to the holding cell.

320
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:19,290
We don't know what will happen
or when,

321
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:23,951
but there are owls
in the Roadhouse.

322
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,458
The Roadhouse.

323
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:34,568
Something is happening,
isn't it, Margaret?

324
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,005
Yes.

325
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:31,187
Say, look here, buster,
you just watch it.

326
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:35,356
Since the moment we met,
l have been strangely attracted to you.

327
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,502
You just better get the hell out of here,
mister.

328
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:43,071
There's something about your eyes,
so warm...

329
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,004
...and deep.

330
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,079
And blue as the sky.

331
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:56,743
Dummy, it's me. lt's me.

332
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,621
Catherine?

333
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:06,029
You look terrible.

334
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:12,663
Just terrible.

335
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:18,033
Just terrible.

336
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:56,203
Tell your heart that l'm the one

337
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:06,384
Tell your heart it's me

338
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:22,931
- You heard about Harold Smith?
- Yeah.

339
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,398
lt's not anybody's fault.

340
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:29,937
He was a sick man.

341
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,168
l think he was hurt inside
in a way l couldn't figure out.

342
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,239
Everybody's hurt inside.

343
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:46,786
His whole life was in that house,
and l violated that.

344
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:50,590
You were just trying to find out
about Laura.

345
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:57,759
James, he's dead.

346
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,504
He didn't deserve that.

347
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:07,934
Shadow in my house

348
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:13,516
The man, he has brown eyes

349
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,614
Sheriff Truman.

350
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,857
Love moves me

351
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:33,363
l want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

352
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:38,703
l want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

353
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,004
Maddy's leaving.

354
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,509
She is?

355
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:48,345
Yeah, she's gonna go home.

356
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:54,754
That's weird.
She never said anything to me.

357
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:14,168
Tell your heart you make me cry

358
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:25,855
Tell your heart don't let me die

359
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:33,192
l want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

360
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:40,497
l want you
Rockin' back inside my heart

361
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:46,374
Rockin' back inside my heart

362
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:55,111
Shadow in my house

363
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:08,260
Dust is dancing in the space

364
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:20,066
A dog and bird are far away

365
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:33,857
The sun comes up and down
Each day

366
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:52,905
lt is happening again.

367
00:38:56,914 --> 00:39:00,509
lt is happening again.

368
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,566
Aunt Sarah?

369
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,870
Uncle Leland?

370
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:07,848
Aunt Sarah, Uncle Leland,
what is that smell?

371
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,078
lt smells like something's burning.

372
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,882
Oh, my gosh. Aunt Sarah?

373
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:55,995
Somebody, help me!

374
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:21,225
Help me!

375
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,416
Laura. Laura.

376
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:54,786
Laura. Laura. Laura.

377
00:41:56,961 --> 00:42:00,658
Laura, my baby.

378
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:04,290
Laura. Laura.

379
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:56,543
Laura.

380
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:01,047
Laura.

381
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:11,030
Leland says...

382
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:16,837
...you're going back to Missoula,
Montana!

383
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:40,713
Dust is dancing in the space

384
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,258
l'm so sorry.

385
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:04,976
The sun comes up and down
Each day

386
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:20,261
The river flows out to the sea

387
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:30,639
Love, don't go away

388
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:35,335
Come back this way

389
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:39,711
Come back and stay

390
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:49,850
Forever and ever
