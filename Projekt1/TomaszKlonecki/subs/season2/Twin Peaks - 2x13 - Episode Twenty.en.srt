1
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:53,393
I remember stepping from the fIames,
a vague shape in the dark,

2
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,585
then nothing.

3
00:01:55,762 --> 00:02:00,358
UntiI I found myseIf standing
by the coId remains of our campfire

4
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:01,933
two days Iater.

5
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,400
Major, there are
some new techniques

6
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,597
that might help us break through
your amnesia.

7
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:11,403
My memories are immune
from regression.

8
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:18,047
I can feeI them, they are paIpabIe,
the smeIIs and sensation.

9
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:23,049
Everything is known to me,
yet somehow beyond my reach.

10
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,316
Do you remember anything else?

11
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,925
Very IittIe.

12
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:32,326
Save for one disturbing image
of a giant owI.

13
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,195
- Pervasive.
- A giant owl?

14
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:43,234
A giant owI? How big?

15
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,004
Enough to cIoud my mind
and memory.

16
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:52,583
Three trianguIar scars behind
the right ear in perfect proportion.

17
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:54,413
Major Briggs,

18
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:58,957
exactIy what does
your work invoIve?

19
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,719
That information's,

20
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,662
as I've repeated endIessIy
to myseIf,

21
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,090
cIassified.

22
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:16,241
Though the keeping of secrets
seems Iess meaningfuI to me now.

23
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:26,982
Perhaps there are sources
of information that are so important

24
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:30,816
as to transcend the human need
to conspire.

25
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:35,052
Information of such weight,
that pertains not--

26
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,391
Oh, God.

27
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:44,395
Is this meant for the souI?

28
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:47,337
My souI?

29
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:55,545
Major, perhaps you'd better
start back at the beginning.

30
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,215
Are you famiIiar
with Project BIue Book?

31
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,688
Yes, sir, I am.

32
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,984
The Air Force investigation
into the phenomena

33
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,320
of unidentified fIying objects.

34
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,362
OfficiaIIy disbanded in 1 969.

35
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,935
But there are those of us

36
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,936
who continue,
in an unofficiaI capacity,

37
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:23,542
examining the heavens as before.

38
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,168
In the case of Twin Peaks,
the earth beIow.

39
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:34,850
We are searching for a pIace
caIIed the White Lodge.

40
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,755
- Major Briggs?
- I've been expecting you.

41
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:43,054
- HoId on just a minute, feIIows.
- CoIoneI RiIey's orders.

42
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,958
I don't care what orders you've got,

43
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,691
this is my station and Major Briggs
happens to be a friend of--

44
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,391
Harry.

45
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:55,938
I'm afraid we wiII have to continue
this discussion at a Iater date.

46
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,077
Are you sure
you wanna go with them?

47
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:59,734
Yeah.

48
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,575
- Goodbye.
- Major.

49
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:41,012
Oh, go ahead, Ernie, it won't bite.

50
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,745
A Iot you know, paI.

51
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:45,516
These men are dangerous thugs,

52
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:48,627
not that I haven't met
pIenty of their kind before.

53
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,126
Jean RenauIt is a hard man,

54
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,264
but I've known men
that wouId make him quiver.

55
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:53,797
Ernie, come on.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,627
Make the caII.

57
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,771
WeII, have we set the buy yet?

58
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:02,430
Trying to.
Ernie's a wee bit gun-shy.

59
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,042
Gun-shy?

60
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,008
Ernie NiIes is as boId as can be.
Let me at him.

61
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,181
PIease don't make me do this.

62
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,687
This is suicide, I know.
PIease, I'm begging you, pIease.

63
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,381
For everybody's sake, pIease.

64
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,323
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie.

65
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,129
HeIIo.

66
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:32,000
May I speak to Jean RenauIt,
pIease?

67
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,173
Hi, Jean. Yeah, I've got
that big out-of-town buy here.

68
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,148
Hi, Lucy.

69
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,694
Where have you been, Andrew?

70
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,230
There was a cat in a tree.

71
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,493
A peace officer's work
is never done.

72
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,435
But fortunateIy for us, my efforts
have borne more paIatabIe fruit.

73
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:09,837
I paid the Happy HeIping Hand
adoption agency a visit,

74
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,842
where severaI bIue-haired Iadies
were onIy too happy to sup

75
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,741
from my open paIm.

76
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:18,077
UnfortunateIy,
IittIe Nicky's records have been seaIed

77
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,878
and returned to the orphanage.

78
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,613
We'II never know what reaIIy happened
to IittIe Nicky's parents.

79
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,451
Courage, Andrew.
Do not despair, dear boy.

80
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,594
Next stop,
that seIfsame orphanage.

81
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,525
And IittIe Nicky's records within.

82
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,393
- Maybe we shouId teII Lucy.
- AbsoIuteIy not.

83
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,964
This, dear boy,
is strictIy a man's job.

84
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,232
FoIIow me.

85
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,239
- Lucy.
- Hi.

86
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,079
Any Iuck?

87
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:56,279
I checked the personaIs coIumns
in every nationaI newspaper on the Iist,

88
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,448
and I didn't see anything
that Iooked Iike a chess deaI

89
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,720
or find any mention
of the name Windom EarIe.

90
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,625
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,732
It's okay.

92
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,335
More coffee?

93
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,549
You bet.

94
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,281
Is everything aII right, Ed?

95
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,651
CouIdn't be better.

96
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,157
This is for you.

97
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,511
Bye for now.

98
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,507
Bye-bye.

99
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,858
Come on, Leo.

100
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,587
That's a good Leo.

101
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,129
Each day brings a new beginning.

102
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,532
And every hour, the promise of...

103
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,730
It was your turn to feed him, Bobby!

104
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,068
I got practice.

105
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,541
FootbaII season is over.

106
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:29,648
BasebaII.
Our nationaI pastime?

107
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,752
Fine. You can cIean
when you get back.

108
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,850
I ain't coming back.

109
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,855
What?

110
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,754
You're Iooking
at Ben Horne's brand-new boy.

111
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,093
Do the words ''goIden opportunity''
mean anything to you?

112
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,497
This is my big break, SheIIy.

113
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,398
You don't think
I have anything better to do

114
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:53,038
than give Leo Johnson
a bubbIe bath?

115
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:54,537
And what about me, Bobby?

116
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,676
Do I not have anything better to do?

117
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,778
Not that I can think of.

118
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,580
Bobby.

119
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,517
Bobby!

120
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:10,845
Bobby!

121
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,099
God!

122
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,152
Big Ed's Gas Farm.

123
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,617
- UncIe Ed?
- James?

124
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,484
- Yeah, it's me.
- Where are you? Are you all right?

125
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,488
Oh, I'm okay.

126
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,491
Look, I need a favor.

127
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:53,288
I need you to get aII the money
out of my savings account.

128
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,058
That's only $ 1 2, James.

129
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,065
WeII, whatever's Ieft.

130
00:10:57,236 --> 00:11:01,468
And send it care of me to WaIIies.
It's this bar out on 96.

131
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,835
Are you in trouble?

132
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,978
No, I reaIIy can't taIk about it.

133
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,114
- James--
- Listen, I reaIIy can't taIk right now.

134
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,113
- Okay.
- We'II taIk about it soon.

135
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:12,512
- Take care.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,347
- Call soon.
- Okay, bye.

137
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,423
- Long-distance?
- Twin Peaks.

138
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,458
Are you homesick, James?

139
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,956
No.

140
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,131
TeII me about Twin Peaks.

141
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:29,665
There's nothing to say.

142
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,601
You couId start with why you Ieft.

143
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:35,970
It was a woman, as I recaII.

144
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,871
No, you said it was a few of them.

145
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,543
I Ioved a girI who died.

146
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,149
Her name was Laura.

147
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,778
And I thought I knew her,
but I didn't.

148
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,156
I guess nobody did.

149
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:55,055
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,864
My Iife used to make sense,
you know?

151
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,800
I didn't Iike it aII the time,
but it was mine.

152
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,199
And I feIt Iike it beIonged to me.

153
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,912
And then Laura died.

154
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:19,039
And now I beIong to something eIse.

155
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,554
To Laura.

156
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,228
And no matter what I did,

157
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:34,491
or how much I tried to heIp...

158
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,498
...another girI got murdered.

159
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,311
I just wanted to get on my bike
and ride away.

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,847
Take off, just go as far from
Twin Peaks as the thing wiII take me.

161
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,515
I know the feeIing, James.

162
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,853
I know the feeIing.

163
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,235
Why do you Iet him hurt you?

164
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,247
Jeffrey's Ieaving.

165
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:31,890
I need you. WiII you heIp me?

166
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,720
- Mr. Marsh.
- What do you mean?

167
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:38,455
- I need your heIp.
- I'II put the bags in for you.

168
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,423
Very good, sir.

169
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:54,079
- Good morning, Mike NeIson.
- Oh, Lord.

170
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,977
You wanna share a soda?

171
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,985
How about a nice big piece
of cherry pie? Two forks.

172
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,919
Mrs. HurIey, Nadine,
I want my own piece of cherry pie.

173
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:09,425
In fact, I want two pieces
of cherry pie, by myseIf.

174
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,826
Okay. Meat Ioaf.

175
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,958
No. Cherry pie and coffee.
In fact, I want 1 6 cups of coffee.

176
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,831
I don't wanna taIk with you,
waIk with you.

177
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,996
I don't wanna see you,
I don't wanna know you.

178
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,607
Is that cIear enough to understand?

179
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:26,905
Or do I need a court order
to get my point across?

180
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,108
Mike NeIson,

181
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:36,779
you are the handsomest boy
I've ever known.

182
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:40,154
And I wouId reaIIy Iike it

183
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:44,990
if you and I couId go out on a date.

184
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,675
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:04,873
Sometimes I can't heIp myseIf.

186
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,596
Hey, Norma. Where are you going?

187
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,068
I have to run some errands.

188
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,038
It's a IittIe earIy for errands, isn't it?

189
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,972
We've stiII got most
of the breakfast crowd.

190
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,406
Just you and a kitchen fuII
of scrambIed eggs.

191
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,242
I'II be right back.

192
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:41,412
Just think of it as a test, Hank.

193
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,386
I'II do that.

194
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,813
I thought you were moving
into my pIace.

195
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,753
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

196
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,654
What the heII are you doing here?

197
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,954
- This is my home.
- Home?

198
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,224
After everything Catherine
has done to you?

199
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,331
I have no choice.

200
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,164
Josie.

201
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,265
Josie.

202
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,114
- Oh, go home.
- Josie, Iet me take care of you.

203
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:48,151
- No.
- PIease.

204
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:51,313
Listen, I'm safe here.
And when I'm here,

205
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,321
- you're safe too.
- No.

206
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,965
Stop.

207
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,365
Look at me.

208
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,436
I'm Catherine's maid.

209
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,268
I'm no good for you.

210
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,274
You are good for me.

211
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,883
I Iove you.

212
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,479
I want you.

213
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,050
LuciIIe...

214
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,660
What?

215
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:08,189
What's wrong?

216
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,994
Yes, sir, generaI.

217
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,731
I want you to Iead the charge
on LittIe Round Top.

218
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,431
Yes, sir.

219
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,735
Yes, sir!

220
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:22,369
And where is GeneraI Stuart?
And his cavaIry?

221
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,574
He's a-coming, sir.
Damn his eyes.

222
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:28,015
- He's coming, sir. I know it!
- Daddy!

223
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,211
- He's coming. He had better be.
- Daddy.

224
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,448
For aII our sakes.

225
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:36,856
Because the enemy,
we meet the enemy here.

226
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:40,021
We meet him before morning.

227
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,759
- We meet him here.
- Daddy.

228
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,873
Yes, darIing?

229
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,372
What are you doing?

230
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:55,236
There's a war going on, darIing.

231
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:56,972
A war?

232
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,743
A war between the states.

233
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,083
Daddy, I think you need some heIp.

234
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,283
No, no, I'm aII right, darIing.

235
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:13,957
I just need a IittIe time.
This is a very important day.

236
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,930
Yes, Daddy,
this is a very important day.

237
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,796
We're gonna save the business.

238
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,234
- You and I.
- DarIing, darIing.

239
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,998
Yes, Daddy?

240
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,802
You are standing on GeneraI Stuart.

241
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,709
GeneraI Lee!

242
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,516
GeneraI Lee! Yes, sir.
OId Jeb, he's come.

243
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:39,246
Oh, I don't need any more wagons!

244
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:42,917
I want my eyes
and my ears beside me.

245
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:44,756
- Get me GeneraI Stuart.
- This is Audrey.

246
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,421
- I need you to get me Jerry Horne.
- Bring me GeneraI Norton.

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,795
- Ready the men of the AIabama 1 5th.
- This is an emergency.

248
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:57,238
- I've been figuring that we have to--
- I think we need to taIk about what--

249
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,443
Come on in.

250
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,787
You first.

251
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,151
Okay.

252
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,859
You're the Iast thing I think of
when I go to sIeep at night.

253
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,887
And you're the first thought
on my mind

254
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,031
when I get up in the morning.

255
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,298
I know this worId is going to pieces,

256
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,802
and it feeIs Iike it's designed
to keep us apart.

257
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,702
But we Iove each other, Ed.

258
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,812
I wanna be with you.

259
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:38,307
I wanna be with you
no matter what happens.

260
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:51,485
Ed, Ed, Ed. Your turn.

261
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,529
Later.

262
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,373
WiII you mind the chest hair,
wiII you?

263
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,446
You're sweating Iike a pig, Mr. NiIes.

264
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:12,448
Oh, thanks a Iot.

265
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:16,452
That's nervous perspiration, man.
Hyperhidrosis.

266
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:17,884
It's a chiIdhood condition.

267
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:22,221
I didn't notice it tiII the war.
Korea, remember that year?

268
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:25,192
I was Ieading a battaIion
up towards the 49th paraIIeI.

269
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:27,696
We were just a bunch
of fresh-faced kids.

270
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,096
I didn't know what kind of heII
we were stepping into.

271
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:34,535
Ernie. Ernie, I want you to focus
on the here and now.

272
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,970
Repeat your instructions to me
step by step.

273
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:39,201
Okay.

274
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:46,074
I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm.

275
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:49,880
- I introduce her to RenauIt.
- Right.

276
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:54,483
I take RenauIt through the buy,

277
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,890
compIete the transaction
and get the heII out of there.

278
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,991
Good. Harry?
That's when you come in.

279
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:06,465
By goIIy, I sure wish
I couId join you feIIas.

280
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,971
But I've temporariIy Iost
my enforcement franchise.

281
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,132
- I'II bet.
- WeII,

282
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,244
I've been giving that
some thought.

283
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,674
Consider yourseIf deputized.

284
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,550
The Bureau's Ioss is my gain.

285
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,879
I hope I can Iive up to this.

286
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,157
He's done. You might wanna
toweI him off before we go.

287
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,420
Come on.

288
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,359
How Iong wiII it take you guys

289
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,300
to storm the farmhouse
after I compIete the buy?

290
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,462
You go out, we come in.

291
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:44,700
- Can I ask you a question?
- What, Ernie?

292
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:47,002
Don't make me do this.
This isn't my Iine of work.

293
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,807
I'm a coward. I don't do
this kind of thing, I'm a CPA.

294
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:51,677
- Ernie.
- Ernie.

295
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:56,010
Just a momentary Iapse.
Look, I'm cooI.

296
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:57,450
Let's go do it, huh?

297
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:01,857
- Where's Denise?
- I haven't seen her.

298
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:05,221
You can caII me Dennis.

299
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:09,967
Oh, I don't know,
somehow it seemed more appropriate.

300
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,203
What do you think?

301
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,847
Our investigation
must proceed sub rosa.

302
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:32,346
We may have to pick the Iock.
Tricky business.

303
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,061
VoiIa. We enter.

304
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,695
- Where is everybody?
- Lunch.

305
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,698
Here we are, the case fiIes.

306
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,929
N, N.

307
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,075
N, N !

308
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:58,214
NaiIs, Neaster,
Neatherby, NeedIeman.

309
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:01,181
NichoIas NeedIeman,
our IittIe Nicky.

310
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,913
- We can read it in the car.
- Patience, Andrew.

311
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,684
- Dick.
- The usuaI background information.

312
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,718
BirthpIace,

313
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,697
initiaI adoption.

314
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,228
First of severaI, it seems.

315
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,233
Dick.

316
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,373
The pIot thickens.

317
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,104
Where are thy secrets, IittIe Nicky?

318
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,247
Dick.

319
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,882
Hi.

320
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,090
We're the Brunstons.

321
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,422
I know we're a IittIe earIy.

322
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,655
It's just that we're so darn eager
to see him.

323
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,299
Can we see him? Where is Donnie?

324
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:53,837
LittIe Donnie is dead.

325
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,175
Dead tired, I mean.

326
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:04,112
I'm afraid IittIe Donnie,
he isn't feeIing up to snuff.

327
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,114
WeII, he was in perfect heaIth
onIy yesterday.

328
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,115
- Dick.
- Just a minute.

329
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,192
Woody, Iet me finish heIping
these good peopIe.

330
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,989
Now, where were we?

331
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:23,091
Ed. Ed, it's Donna.

332
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:28,139
- I need your heIp, Ed.
- What can I do for you, honey?

333
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,672
WeII, I've been Iooking for James.

334
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:32,208
He hasn't been in schooI,
no one's seen him at the diner.

335
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,470
I even went by his house,
but I can't find him.

336
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,944
Listen, James is fine. He caIIed.

337
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:41,313
He asked me to send him some money
in care of a bar out on 96.

338
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,647
We didn't taIk Iong.

339
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:47,019
- It's aII I know.
- I'II take it to him.

340
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:48,682
WeII, what about your foIks?

341
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,193
I'II expIain, they'II understand.

342
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:54,958
- Okay.
- Thanks, Ed.

343
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,501
I have to get going.

344
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:05,666
I'II caII.

345
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,711
- We have a Iot to taIk about.
- Yeah.

346
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,507
- Bye.
- Bye.

347
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,221
Oh, Ed. The things we do for Iove.

348
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:34,069
Eddie, I'm home.

349
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,403
Eddie! Look out!

350
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,229
You big buIIy!

351
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,674
Eddie?

352
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,305
Can you hear me?

353
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,876
- Nadine?
- Yeah, Nadine's here.

354
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,448
Don't you worry about a thing, baby.

355
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:25,681
Nadine wiII take care of everything.

356
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,664
CoIoneI ChamberIain
and the 20th Maine

357
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:42,102
were trapped at the summit
of LittIe Round Top.

358
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:45,437
Now, his onIy chance

359
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,239
is to maneuver his Ieft fIank

360
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:52,611
down the hiIIside
Iike a swinging gate.

361
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,308
But we were waiting for him, Bobby.

362
00:27:55,787 --> 00:28:01,657
And ChamberIain's desperate
maneuver ended, Bobby, in faiIure.

363
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:05,422
- Mr. Horne--
- LittIe Round Top, Bobby, was ours.

364
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,465
From that vantage point, we were abIe
to roII back the FederaI Iines.

365
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:14,867
Setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge, Bobby.

366
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:20,271
And victory!

367
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,116
Victory. Hurray.

368
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,693
GeneraI Meade,

369
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:44,561
you have suffered an ignobIe defeat.

370
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,964
And I accept
your unconditionaI surrender.

371
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,639
Okay, teII you what, Mr. Horne.

372
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:59,807
I'm gonna go and taIk
to President LincoIn first, okay?

373
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:03,351
So you just wait right here and...

374
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:10,521
And I'II get back to you
on this whoIe surrender thing.

375
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:12,185
Okay? Gotta go.

376
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:17,895
Don't wanna keep
the president waiting.

377
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:20,803
Sir!

378
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:28,236
Baby, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

379
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:32,774
The bad news is that your oId man
just bought a condo in FIip City.

380
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:36,114
The good news is that he's about
to win the CiviI War.

381
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:37,754
I know.

382
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:40,892
UncIe Jerry said he was coming home
on the next pIane.

383
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,551
Dr. Jacoby said
he wouId come over tomorrow.

384
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,596
I think Daddy needs an injection.

385
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,597
God, we gotta heIp him.

386
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:52,293
Don't worry, baby,
Bobby's on the case.

387
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,769
Don't caII me baby.

388
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,119
Enter IiveIy.

389
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
Catherine.

390
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,458
HeIIo, Ben.

391
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,938
You've come here to gIoat,
haven't you?

392
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,276
To ceIebrate my demise.

393
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:39,447
WeII, you go ahead. You Iaugh.

394
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,254
You defeated me...

395
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:47,289
...as I have defeated GeneraI Meade.

396
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,493
It's true.

397
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,991
I did come here to gIoat.

398
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:00,463
You doubIe-crossed me.

399
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:02,401
You tried to kiII me.

400
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:07,469
And I wanted to bury you so deepIy

401
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:12,447
that future generations wouId unearth
and exhibit your remains.

402
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:16,144
SIimy rat bastard Americanus.

403
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:18,653
Do not feed.

404
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:25,294
Do not trust.

405
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,533
I suppose...

406
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:35,732
...that I'm not that trustworthy.

407
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:47,377
Despite everything
I know about you,

408
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:52,016
I find myseIf here with you.

409
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,189
Wanting you.

410
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,488
You can't be serious.

411
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,192
I want you, Ben.

412
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:11,100
Horrifying as it seems,
I can't escape it.

413
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,243
You...

414
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:20,210
You make my body hum.

415
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,787
Kiss me, GeneraI Lee.

416
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,210
On to victory!

417
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:52,615
Hurry up, Jim.
The champagne's getting warm.

418
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,252
Don't caII me Jim.

419
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:59,785
AII right, aII right, aII right.

420
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:05,292
- James, what?
- You may Iook!

421
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,457
Any pIace you wanna go?

422
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:13,664
Jeffrey wiII be home by midnight.

423
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,669
Doesn't Ieave us a Iot of time.

424
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,335
WeII, I'II take what we can get.

425
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:22,604
It's a deaI.

426
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,621
To handsome strangers.

427
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:36,158
And rebuiIt engines.

428
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,297
You know, I never thought
I'd see it drive again.

429
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:45,197
You're a miracIe worker.

430
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,861
No, honest.

431
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,305
You're being too modest.

432
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,769
Oh, go on. You deserve it.

433
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:55,810
You're strong and you're kind.

434
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,949
You have a wonderfuIIy honest face,
James.

435
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,616
Don't Iaugh, it's quite rare.

436
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:06,719
Every time I Iook at you,
I couId teII exactIy what you're thinking.

437
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:10,621
WeII, I'd better be carefuI
about what I'm thinking.

438
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,160
Don't be too carefuI.

439
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,729
Not on my account.

440
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:19,536
So, what are your pIans?

441
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:21,905
I don't reaIIy have any pIans.

442
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:24,302
Where wiII you go?

443
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,376
I don't know.

444
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:30,839
- James, don't.
- What?

445
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:33,313
I don't want you to Ieave.

446
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,412
Give me some more time, James.

447
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:40,052
I can think of a hundred reasons
for you to stay.

448
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,147
You sure you don't wanna wait
for Hank?

449
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,649
He toId me this morning
he wanted in on aII of this.

450
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,311
- I think we shouId wait--
- We'II start without him.

451
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,423
Whatever you say.

452
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:52,321
You're sweating.
Is something wrong?

453
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:56,934
Sweaty. You know, it's hyperhidrosis.
It's a chiIdhood condition.

454
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:00,764
I was Iiving in Guam at the time
I contracted yeIIow fever.

455
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,430
The effects are vicious.

456
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:08,275
You know, sweating is one
of the more sociaIIy unacceptabIe.

457
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,609
Sit down, Ernie. Take a deep breath.

458
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,483
- SociaIIy unacceptabIe.
- Everything seems to be in order.

459
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:19,020
Do you think we couId hurry this up?
I got a pIane to catch.

460
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:23,217
Jean. Jean, take a Iook,
his shirt is smoking.

461
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,362
The wire's dead.

462
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,501
Cooper!

463
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:35,265
- Cooper!
- Coop.

464
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:38,874
He came for me, Harry.

465
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,372
I want safe passage to the border.

466
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,444
First, reIease the hostages.

467
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:46,641
We're at cross-purposes, Cooper.

468
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,543
We'II kiII you if you don't.

469
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,747
Then everybody dies.

470
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:54,314
No, we'II trade.

471
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:57,656
Trade?

472
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:01,126
Ernie NiIes
and agent Bryson for me.

473
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:02,791
Coop.

474
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,569
- I want backup.
- State poIice?

475
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,507
CaII them in.

476
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,780
Lucy, it's Hawk.

477
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,853
Patch me through
to the state poIice.

478
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:03,750
How's our baby boy?

479
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:05,793
Sound asIeep.

480
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:08,262
Dreaming of Iove.

481
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:19,439
Lucky, Iucky, Iucky boy.

482
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:26,476
Lucky, Iucky, Iucky.

483
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,991
They moved him to the center room.

484
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:42,257
Andy, keep steady.

485
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,136
More deputies.

486
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,231
Sharpshooters.

487
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,767
Let's deaI or Iet's run.

488
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:00,242
WiII they Iet us run, Agent Cooper?

489
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,977
No.

490
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:07,784
So you think they wiII deaI?

491
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:10,855
No.

492
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:13,623
What do you suggest we do?

493
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,193
Surrender.

494
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,669
Okay.

495
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:24,767
Are you crazy?

496
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,273
No.

497
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:32,041
But first, we must decide
to give up quietIy or to kiII him.

498
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:37,616
- Then we both die.
- I know.

499
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:41,157
Is my death so important to you?

500
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,955
My two brothers died.

501
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,063
I hoId you responsibIe.

502
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,062
Why?

503
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:01,871
Before you came here,

504
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:05,174
Twin Peaks was a simpIe pIace.

505
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:10,550
My brothers deaI dope
to the teenagers and the truck drivers.

506
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:13,657
One-Eyed Jack's weIcomed
the businessmen and the tourists.

507
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:17,090
Quiet peopIe Iived a quiet Iife.

508
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:21,096
Then, a pretty girI die,

509
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:26,393
and you arrive,
and everything change.

510
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,539
My brother Bernard,

511
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:33,973
shot and Ieft to die in the woods.

512
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:38,271
A grieving father smother
my remaining brother with a piIIow.

513
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:41,850
Kidnapping. Death.

514
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:47,422
SuddenIy, the quiet peopIe,
they're quiet no more.

515
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:54,122
SuddenIy, the simpIe dream
become the nightmare.

516
00:40:54,298 --> 00:41:00,203
So if you die,
maybe you wiII be the Iast to die.

517
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:05,434
Maybe you brought
the nightmare with you.

518
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,602
And maybe the nightmare

519
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,546
wiII die with you.

520
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,046
I don't know what the heII
you're taIking about.

521
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:22,551
But I do know
we've got a damn probIem here.

522
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:26,322
And if you're not gonna soIve it,
I wiII.

523
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,728
- Jean.
- What?

524
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,129
Take a Iook at this.

525
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:34,629
- You order any food?
- No.

526
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:37,339
No, no, no, Iet her come.

527
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,804
Let her come.

528
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,567
It's just a girI.

529
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,924
- HeIIo.
- Suppertime.

530
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:08,662
Don't I know you?

531
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:41,000
Are you okay?

532
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:42,969
Yeah.

533
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,005
Quick thinking, Denise.

534
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:46,541
It was just my Iegs.

535
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:50,807
Thank Sheriff Truman.
It was his idea.

536
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,880
Harry S. Truman.

537
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,987
Sometimes you gotta improvise.

538
00:42:58,356 --> 00:43:00,187
He's dead.

539
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:21,007
Bobby?

540
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,544
Bobby?

541
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:53,870
Bobby, this isn't funny.

542
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:59,175
Bobby?

543
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:07,314
Leo?

544
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,755
SheIIy.

545
00:44:17,735 --> 00:44:20,169
- Bomb. What do you mean, bomb?
- Start at the beginning.

546
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,465
WeII, the voice on the phone said

547
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,835
that there was a bomb
pIanted in the woods,

548
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,601
but it didn't say which woods.

549
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,245
Then aII of a sudden,
there was this huge expIosion

550
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:31,404
and aII the Iights went out.

551
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,140
So then I caIIed
the fire department.

552
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:35,410
- Good work, Lucy.
- Was there a fire?

553
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:38,316
Two of them. First there was one
at the power station.

554
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:40,184
But most
of the voIunteer fire department--

555
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,826
I'm gonna go check on the generator.
Something's not right.

556
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:44,825
Okay. So?

557
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,692
--were pIaying bingo, so it took a whiIe
to get everybody together.

558
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,856
- Excuse me, Lucy.
- Then there was the expIosion

559
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:52,502
I toId you about, which sounded
Iike it was right upstairs,

560
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,332
so we aII got out of here.
WeII, it turned out to be a transformer

561
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:57,440
on the poIe right behind
and above the buiIding.

562
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,303
WeII, we had to wait
to go back inside

563
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,138
because it was shooting sparks
everywhere

564
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,008
and we were afraid that the station
was gonna catch on fire too.

565
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:06,046
- But it didn't.
- Do they know how it started?

566
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,275
Suspicious in nature,
that's what Chief KippIe said.

567
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,478
He was suffering
from smoke inhaIation at the time,

568
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,623
so he sounded a IittIe hoarse.

569
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,224
You shouId hear his cough.

570
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:17,384
I'm gonna make him
some chicken soup.

571
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:20,529
- Harry?
- Yeah, Coop.

572
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,826
You'd better take a Iook
at this, aIone.

573
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:26,162
Lucy, wait here.

574
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,476
Good Lord.

575
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,713
Who is it?

576
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:42,409
I don't know.

577
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,320
It's a chess game.

578
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:48,417
Windom EarIe's next move.



0
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
