1
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:44,175
I trusted you.

2
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:49,214
I invested my heart and souI in you.

3
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,687
- We onIy want to read it.
- We didn't mean any harm.

4
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,292
I thought you were different.

5
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,790
You made me feeI

6
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,364
I couId return to the worId

7
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:05,801
and find something decent, pure.

8
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,405
But you're just Iike aII the others.

9
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,542
You Iie.

10
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,439
And you betray.

11
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,271
And then you Iaugh about it.

12
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,443
You are uncIean.

13
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:21,248
You have contaminated me.

14
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,320
Now give it to me.

15
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:31,761
- Donna.
- Donna.

16
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:34,730
No.

17
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,765
He's not coming. He won't.
He's afraid.

18
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,810
- Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
- No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I--

19
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,016
I'm sorry, James. It's aII my fauIt.

20
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:57,747
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't cry. It's my fauIt too.

21
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,017
We gotta go to the sheriff now, okay?

22
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,921
You've had enough troubIe.
I'II go.

23
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:07,361
- No, I'II go.
- James, just hoId me, okay? Okay.

24
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,929
We're aII set up inside.

25
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,508
SIuggish puIse.

26
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,443
PupiIs constricted.

27
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:31,378
Breathing sIow and shaIIow.

28
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,249
NeedIe marks. Most IikeIy heroin.

29
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,086
Poor kid.

30
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,056
Daddy?

31
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,825
Can you see me?
Can you see me, Daddy?

32
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,898
Audrey, you got to stay awake.

33
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,468
Can you catch me?

34
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,401
- Can you?
- Audrey.

35
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,439
TaIk to me, Audrey.

36
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,136
Stay awake. Audrey?

37
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,643
His tongue is so heavy.

38
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,406
The hand on my throat.

39
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,876
It hurts me.

40
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,783
Oh, God, it hurts me.

41
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,288
BIack coId.

42
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,854
I can't breathe.

43
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,858
HeIp me, pIease, heIp me.

44
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:20,125
I'm sinking. I'm sinking.

45
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:24,497
AII right. It's aII right, Audrey,
I'm right here. Audrey, I'm right here.

46
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:33,573
I prayed.

47
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,606
I prayed that you wouId come.

48
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,313
And you did.

49
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,761
It's okay. It's okay.

50
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,393
She was so brave. I feeI terribIe.
If anything had happened to her...

51
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:01,335
No more pIans, okay?
No more going off on our own.

52
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,033
James, he has Laura's secret diary.
He couId have kiIIed her.

53
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,610
He couId have kiIIed you too.

54
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:11,313
Pretty stupid, huh?

55
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,379
WeII, after Laura died,

56
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,488
everything just went by kind of fast,
you know.

57
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:19,056
It's hard to know exactIy
what to beIieve in.

58
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,919
Yeah.

59
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:24,922
But when I saw you tonight,
I knew exactIy what I beIieved.

60
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,195
Did you?

61
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,798
It's Iike if we couId put
our hearts together

62
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,030
and keep them that way forever,
we'd be safe, no matter what.

63
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,072
You and me?

64
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,639
From now on.

65
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,170
Yes.

66
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,691
How is she?

67
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,894
She is through the worst of it.

68
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,399
Heroin, Harry.

69
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:09,074
This cIose to a IethaI dose.

70
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,837
Hard to imagine such crueIty.

71
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,778
Not reaIIy.

72
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,108
Look at this.

73
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,215
BIackie's kiIIer.

74
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,250
I knew I'd seen him before.

75
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,013
- Jean RenauIt.
- RenauIt?

76
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,286
OIdest brother
of Jacques and Bernard.

77
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:27,790
HeII of a Iot more dangerous.

78
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,858
He runs the northern territories.

79
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,123
GambIing, drugs, extortion,
you name it.

80
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,266
Now, I saw

81
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:39,064
a tape on the TV in BIackie's office
of you

82
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,708
pIaying bIackjack the night
you and Big Ed went to the casino.

83
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,276
Jean RenauIt was after me.

84
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,536
The man who caught his brother.

85
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:51,376
He pIanned to kiII me
and he used Audrey as bait.

86
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,411
I went out of my jurisdiction.

87
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:57,783
Twice.

88
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,584
I've vioIated my professionaI code

89
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,750
and now Audrey is paying the price.

90
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,789
You got her back.
And she's gonna be okay.

91
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:08,830
This isn't the first time my actions
have brought suffering to someone

92
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,334
I care about, in the name
of doing what I had to do.

93
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,335
Damn it. I shouId have known better.

94
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,303
Doesn't change the fact
that she's here now,

95
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:18,671
not up at Jack's with a needIe
in her arm.

96
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,109
You know,

97
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,847
you are the best Iawman

98
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:31,917
I've ever seen.

99
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,353
But, Coop,

100
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:35,686
sometimes you think too much.

101
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,925
Thank you, Harry.

102
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,951
Agent Cooper.

103
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,090
I got your caII.

104
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,157
What happened? Did you...?

105
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:11,797
I was abIe to free your daughter
without the payment.

106
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,133
Thank God.

107
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,735
She was being heId at a brotheI
north of the border,

108
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,236
known as One-Eyed Jack's.

109
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:21,799
No.

110
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,667
It seems the brotheI's madam
was at Ieast partiaIIy responsibIe

111
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,473
for her kidnapping
and subsequent bIackmaiI.

112
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,646
Did you arrest her?

113
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,149
She was kiIIed
before I couId question her.

114
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,082
No.

115
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:39,316
Murdered by a man named
Jean RenauIt.

116
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,753
This Jean RenauIt,
did you catch him?

117
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:46,195
He escaped.

118
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,760
Too bad.

119
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:57,673
WeII, everything seems to be
in order.

120
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,345
Your daughter is recovering
from a drug overdose.

121
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,381
Drug overdose?

122
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,278
Oh, my God.

123
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,752
She's gonna be aII right.

124
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:14,218
Can I see her?

125
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,895
She's resting comfortabIy now,
I wouIdn't disturb her.

126
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,390
I'II caII you in the morning.

127
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,763
Yes.

128
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,196
Yes, you do that, Agent Cooper.

129
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,234
Thank you.

130
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,074
Thank you

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,908
for bringing my Audrey back to me.

132
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,585
Good night, Mr. Horne.

133
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,656
Poor feIIow is reaIIy gone.

134
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,524
You ain't kidding.

135
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,328
Oh, I want you to know
how much I admire you kids,

136
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,165
standing by Mr. Johnson.

137
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,470
Not taking the easy way out.

138
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,836
Most peopIe wouId just ship him off.

139
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:42,242
Yeah, weII, Leo's sort of speciaI
to us both.

140
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:48,515
BeIieve you me, in-home care
is the stuff of miracIes.

141
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,053
Mr. Johnson shouId benefit
tremendousIy

142
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,487
from being here
among his Ioved ones.

143
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,752
Oh, we certainIy hope so.

144
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,988
WiII you be hiring
fuII- or part-time heIp?

145
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,997
Cousin Bobby and I
wiII be here fuII-time.

146
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,631
I just admire your dedication.

147
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:14,541
WeII, everything Iooks to be in order.

148
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,909
You might want to chiIdproof
those eIectricaI sockets.

149
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,142
Okay.

150
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,979
PIease sign right there.

151
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,586
- Your check.
- Thank you.

152
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,433
There must be a mistake.

153
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,035
- Seven hundred bucks?
- Sad, isn't it?

154
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:49,339
The cost of heaIth care
is going through the roof.

155
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,210
It's bringing rain.

156
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:54,245
We're supposed to get
5,000 a month.

157
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,946
But with figure state and IocaI taxes,
equipment fees,

158
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:01,354
medicaI and maintenance costs,
administrative fees...

159
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,893
WeII, you see the resuIts.

160
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,463
FortunateIy with you two here,

161
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,635
Mr. Johnson wiII be
more than adequateIy provided for.

162
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,701
Good Iuck.

163
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,271
I'II find my own way out.

164
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,443
I have to quit my job, Bobby.

165
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,240
How am I going to make it on this?

166
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,974
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

167
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,843
It was your bright idea
to bring him here in the first pIace.

168
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,956
Come on, SheIIy, I'm thinking, aII right.

169
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,855
You better think of something, Bobby.
For the both of us.

170
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,131
Donna, we aIready have
Laura PaImer's diary.

171
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,239
No, this is her secret diary.

172
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:53,242
- She gave it to this Howard Smith?
- HaroId.

173
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,277
- Why?
- I don't know why.

174
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,449
To hide it or something.

175
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,485
Did he ever actuaIIy show you
the diary?

176
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,013
No.

177
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,025
But he read from it.
I saw her name on the inside cover.

178
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,526
- Her handwriting.
- Are you and James up to something?

179
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,659
He has been warned
not to get mixed up--

180
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,800
James has nothing to do with this.

181
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:19,199
Donna, it is a Iot Iike
the boy who cried woIf.

182
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,764
The Iast time you pIayed this game,

183
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:24,465
Dr. Jacoby ended up in a hospitaI bed.

184
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,806
It's not a game.

185
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,776
AII right.

186
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,475
I'II try to get someone out there
to take a Iook.

187
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,984
But my hands are fuII.
I can't promise anything.

188
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:39,420
Excuse me, I'm Iooking
for a Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

189
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,718
- You found him.
- Sheriff, pIease.

190
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,020
Excuse me, I'm Iooking
for Sheriff Harry S. Truman.

191
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,460
- That's me.
- FederaI Bureau of Investigation

192
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,463
RegionaI Bureau Chief, Gordon CoIe.

193
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,966
That's a reaI mouthfuI,
but I can't hear myseIf anyway.

194
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,229
I'm Agent Cooper's supervisor.

195
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:56,134
- PIeasure to meet you.
- Can I speak with you a moment?

196
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,708
Sure. Donna.

197
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,542
Wait here.

198
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,680
And who did you say you were?

199
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:08,581
- I'm Sheriff Truman.
- Great. Pay dirt.

200
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,086
You have to speak up, sheriff,
hearing's gone. Long story.

201
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,316
Got these things
cranked up to the max.

202
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,856
Are you Iooking for Agent Cooper?

203
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:21,397
When an agent goes down in the fieId,
I jump right up and pay a visit.

204
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,034
Agent Cooper's not here right now.

205
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,431
AIbert RosenfieId wiII not be
coming back,

206
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:28,096
but I've got his Iab report right here.

207
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,741
Item: a Vicuna coat.

208
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:35,505
AIbert found fibers in the haII outside
of Cooper's room from a Vicuna coat.

209
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,274
Coat was Vicuna?

210
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,551
Sounds reaI good, sheriff,
but I aIready ate.

211
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,619
AIso got a Iab report from AIbert
on the one-armer's syringe.

212
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:50,386
AIbert has never seen a drug Iike it.
A combo. ReaIIy weird stuff.

213
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:51,927
What eIse does AIbert say?

214
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,928
Papers. Papers found near
the bIoody toweI

215
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,091
down the train tracks
from the crime site.

216
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,236
- From a diary.
- PIease.

217
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,370
There's the one-armer now.

218
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,633
Since when is seIIing shoes
against the Iaw?

219
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,936
Mr. Gerard, we need to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,704
Why don't we move over to my office.

221
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:16,549
- My office.
- Right.

222
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,128
She Iooks Iike an angeI.

223
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,233
Audrey?

224
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:32,904
Audrey?

225
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,436
Your father is here.

226
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,437
Thank God, Audrey.

227
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,777
Thank God.

228
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,144
I was so worried about you.

229
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,488
Were you?

230
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,689
I was worried sick.

231
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,989
You know, it's times Iike these

232
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,498
that make a man aware
of the vaIue of Iife.

233
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,068
Every raindrop, every sunset.

234
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,869
I'm aware of a Iot of new things too,
Daddy.

235
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:21,583
Now, we wiII get you home,
safe, warm, in your own bed.

236
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:27,592
What a terribIe experience,
terribIe peopIe.

237
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:32,388
- The things that you must have seen.
- I saw so much.

238
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,099
We'II sort it out.

239
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,865
Together.

240
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,366
Yes, Daddy.

241
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,908
You and I.

242
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,514
That's my girI.

243
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,358
My car is outside.

244
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,496
I'II take her home now.

245
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,735
- Daddy?
- Yes, darIing.

246
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,536
I wouId Iike Agent Cooper to take me
home if that's aII right with you.

247
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,907
Fine.

248
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,379
Maybe...

249
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,086
Maybe we couId aII go together.

250
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,722
Hi, Ed. I'm home.

251
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:40,098
Isn't this the sweIIest dress
you have ever seen?

252
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,960
Do you know
they didn't Iook at me twice

253
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:43,897
when I used the charge card?

254
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:47,595
Say, Ed, when do my parents
get back from Europe, anyway?

255
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,605
WeII, pretty soon.

256
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,406
It's neat having the pIace
aII to ourseIves.

257
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,172
Pretend it's ours.

258
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:58,975
Like we were married or something.

259
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,083
WeII, we can do that. Nadine--

260
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:04,085
And there's some other stuff
we can do too.

261
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,689
WeII, Iike what?

262
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,758
You know, siIIy.

263
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:12,628
You know what I was thinking?

264
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:16,165
Tonight maybe we couId go park
by the Iake,

265
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,200
and neck.

266
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,505
Wait a minute.

267
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,299
We don't have to go anywhere.

268
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,809
Why, we can just stay right here.

269
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:45,463
You've kept yourseIf in fine nick,
Josie.

270
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,126
Sapphire earrings,

271
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,165
Parisian perfume,

272
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,927
cashmere sweaters.

273
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,434
PIease go.

274
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,336
One-way ticket.

275
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,444
SeattIe, Hong Kong.

276
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,778
- I have one more day.
- Keep what you earn.

277
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:10,652
See what you can fit
into your suitcases.

278
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,847
We Ieave tonight.

279
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,454
I haven't received
my insurance money.

280
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:20,791
And Ben Horne hasn't paid me yet
either.

281
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,667
I waited for this for five years.

282
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:27,564
Mr. Eckhardt wiII make it more
than worth your whiIe.

283
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,501
You can't make me Ieave.

284
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,652
Be adaptabIe.

285
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:45,984
We had an arrangement.

286
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:51,056
Sheriff Truman is important to you.

287
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,555
You Iied to him.

288
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,231
You made him into a fooI.

289
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:00,428
But he is important to you
nonetheIess.

290
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:05,535
Leave with me tonight.
Or I'II kiII him.

291
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,076
He doesn't know anything.

292
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:13,441
The pIane Ieaves at midnight.
Be there.

293
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:17,053
Or I'II come for you and your sheriff.

294
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,757
That's the arrangement.

295
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:53,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

296
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:57,990
I think I owe you an apoIogy.

297
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,657
Not reaIIy.

298
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,365
WeII, when we were together,
you know, just taIking,

299
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:10,235
I feIt something. I just wasn't sure.

300
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,637
You Iooked at me and you saw Laura.

301
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:14,977
I guess I did.

302
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,409
Wanna know something
kind of strange?

303
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,414
What?

304
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,419
I Iiked it.

305
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,087
You did?

306
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,755
When we were growing up,

307
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:31,327
Laura and I were so cIose.
It was scary.

308
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,020
I couId feeI her thoughts,

309
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,666
Iike our brains were connected
or something.

310
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:37,493
And when she died suddenIy,

311
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,695
I got the chance to be Laura.

312
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:42,198
At Ieast other peopIe saw me that way.

313
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,700
Like the way that you Iooked at me.

314
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,512
I Iiked that too.

315
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,642
But it was wrong.

316
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:58,486
It wasn't one thing or the other.

317
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,290
For a whiIe,
I got to be somebody different.

318
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,298
But now I'm just me again.

319
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,128
James,

320
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:15,569
you and Donna beIong together.

321
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:18,333
That's the best thing.

322
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:27,578
- It's just hard sometimes, you know?
- How?

323
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:29,978
If you reaIIy Iove someone,

324
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:32,919
it's Iike this bright Iight
is shining on you aII the time.

325
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,890
You're right in it and it's great.

326
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:40,589
But I just don't think you can be
that way aII the time.

327
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:43,960
Sure you can.

328
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,567
WeII, I want to.

329
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,272
I want to try to make the way
my heart feeIs Iast forever.

330
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,172
Pretty weird.

331
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:05,054
I'm going home tomorrow, James.

332
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:10,126
I came to Twin Peaks
for Laura's funeraI.

333
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,889
But now it's time to go.

334
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,699
So is this goodbye?

335
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,305
I guess it is.

336
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,749
Bye, James.

337
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,732
To the fire.

338
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:10,479
Now, to what do I owe
the pIeasure of this caII?

339
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:14,323
I've got the contract
with Pete's signature.

340
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,619
And I want my money.

341
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,421
Of course you do.

342
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,066
AII of it. Now.
Before you get this.

343
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,861
Josie, Josie.

344
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:28,603
SureIy a mind
as quicksiIver as your own

345
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:31,538
can grasp the compIicated position
that we're in.

346
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,337
FIuidity is everything, you know.

347
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:36,879
I can't summon up cash reserves
that I don't have.

348
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:40,482
But I have aIready

349
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:44,110
and I wiII be happy
to assure you again

350
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,348
that as soon as
the contracted payments

351
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,119
arrive from IceIand,

352
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:53,230
your percentage wiII immediateIy be
passed on.

353
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,232
I won't Ieave this office
without my money.

354
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:04,469
Why do I sense
that this isn't a negotiabIe position?

355
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,909
You're under some kind of pressure,
aren't you?

356
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,883
Do not pIay games with me.

357
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,250
Games?

358
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,750
Josie,

359
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:27,490
this key unIocks
my personaI hoteI safe.

360
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,167
Now, in that safe,

361
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:34,430
I have put together
a fascinating dossier on you, my dear,

362
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,769
and your Iate husband--
Andrew's IittIe boat that went boom.

363
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:42,503
So you behave yourseIf, Iady,

364
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:49,382
or beIieve me when I say
that I wiII bury you.

365
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,920
That's a shame.

366
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:56,423
Because if anything unfortunate
were to happen to me,

367
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,755
it wouId Iead authorities

368
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:03,298
to a certain safety deposit box
in a bank in another city,

369
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:05,867
inside of which
there is enough evidence

370
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,530
to Iock you away for three Iifetimes.

371
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,609
They wiII bury us side by side.

372
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:22,215
StaIemate.

373
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:25,556
Your move.

374
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,318
Cash.

375
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:38,397
HappiIy, I can accommodate you.

376
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:44,771
Sign of good faith.

377
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,274
Tokyo bank.

378
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:58,988
Five miIIion doIIars.

379
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,293
We are finished.

380
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,005
Josie.

381
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:19,176
WeII pIayed.

382
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:40,825
- Leo.
- Leo.

383
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:45,560
We sort of figured
with you getting out and aII.

384
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:49,467
WeII, what the heII, we sort of wanted
to give you a IittIe party.

385
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:53,041
Our way of saying,
''Hey, Leo Johnson, weIcome home.''

386
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,007
WeIcome home, darIing.

387
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,876
Because you're a speciaI guy, Leo.
And we just want you to know

388
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:03,680
that we remember aII the great stuff
you did for the ones you Ioved.

389
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,289
Like SheIIy here.

390
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,188
Who couId ask for a more caring
and thoughtfuI husband?

391
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:15,594
Making her cIean your dirty cIothes.
Wash your dishes.

392
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,803
Mop your fIoors.
You're a cIass act, man.

393
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,097
- Top to bottom.
- CIass act.

394
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:24,399
And how about Leo Johnson,
wife abuser?

395
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,839
There's a guy I wanna party with.

396
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,945
Soap in a sock.

397
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,945
InternaI injuries
and bareIy Ieaves a bruise.

398
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:35,243
And Iast, but I'm thinking,

399
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:36,716
not Ieast,

400
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,117
we got Leo Johnson, murderer.

401
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:41,689
Hanging your wife up
Iike a piece of meat.

402
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,588
Leaving her to burn.

403
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:45,421
Don't Iet anybody ever teII you

404
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,030
you don't know how to treat
a woman, buddy.

405
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,702
This is your Iife, Leo Johnson.

406
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,232
You deserve it.

407
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:03,270
Every damn minute.

408
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:27,936
He moved.

409
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,268
- This is too creepy. I don't Iike this.
- Okay. Okay, SheI--

410
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,966
Okay, maybe you're right.

411
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,910
I mean, I don't want to expIoit him
or nothing.

412
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:40,278
Sorry, Leo.
We sort of got carried away.

413
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:45,752
No need to make your rehabiIitation
any more difficuIt than it aIready is.

414
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:49,256
Doc Hayward said
you needed famiIiar stimuIus.

415
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:52,794
So we just figured,
what the heII...

416
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:54,454
...kazoos.

417
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,190
Honest, Leo.

418
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:59,427
SheIIy and me are going
to do everything we can

419
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:01,265
to make you feeI safe and happy.

420
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:03,835
Hey, cake. You want some cake?

421
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,806
Oh, Iook at that.

422
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:14,144
Ice cream.

423
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,979
Bobby.

424
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,955
Hey, Leo. Oh, jeez.

425
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,727
Man, you gotta be more carefuI.

426
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,859
Good thing we didn't Iight the candIes.

427
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,007
Agent DaIe Cooper.

428
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:46,480
Gordon, I hope you haven't been
waiting too Iong.

429
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:49,916
I didn't just get here. I've been waiting
the whoIe afternoon to see you.

430
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,146
What can I do for you?

431
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:54,052
No matter whatsoever.
No apoIogy necessary.

432
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,591
Gave me a chance to meet
the IocaI Iaw enforcement team.

433
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,956
A great bunch.

434
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:01,660
Cooper.

435
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:06,736
You remind me today
of a smaII Mexican Chihuahua.

436
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:10,431
Can I speak to you
a moment in private, Coop?

437
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,042
Of course, Gordon.

438
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:13,711
Harry, can we use your office?

439
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:17,245
You might ask the sheriff
if we couId use his office.

440
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,607
Go right ahead.

441
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:22,378
FoIIow me, Gordon.

442
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:26,247
I beIieve in secrecy, Coop.

443
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:30,393
I'II make this fast. I didn't want
to say anything in front of the men.

444
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:35,230
It's AIbert's opinion that you might be
getting in over your head.

445
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,200
This worries me, Coop.
I feeI a certain responsibiIity.

446
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,532
- AIbert is wrong, Gordon.
- You went into the chute in Pittsburgh.

447
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,266
And I want to make doubIy sure,
in fact tripIy sure,

448
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,740
that it does not happen again. Copy?

449
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,914
Pittsburgh was a compIeteIy
different story.

450
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,248
I was wounded in Pittsburgh, Gordon,

451
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:56,251
but beyond that,
the case bears no simiIarities.

452
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,584
I must say you Iook aII right.

453
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,725
Trace of circIes under the eyes,
catch up on your sIeep.

454
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:05,521
But restIess nights and uneasy dreams
go with the territory.

455
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,023
I am tired, Gordon.
There is much work to be done.

456
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,431
But mind, body and spirit
are up to the task.

457
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:15,435
Without a doubt, I'm A-okay.

458
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,902
Proud of you, Coop.

459
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,270
Now, Gordon.

460
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:23,811
What the heII is this
about a Mexican Chihuahua?

461
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,176
You've got a probIem
of a different sort here.

462
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:29,319
Two and two do not aIways equaI four.

463
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,587
You ought to know, we can hear
everything you're saying out in the haII.

464
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,249
- Come on in.
- Why don't you invite the sheriff on in.

465
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,960
An anonymous Ietter sent
to home base

466
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:41,155
with your name on it.

467
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:42,856
Looks kind of famiIiar, doesn't it?

468
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:51,965
It's a chess deaI.

469
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:54,937
Looks Iike a chess deaI.

470
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,506
It's an opening move
from Windom EarIe.

471
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,081
Windom EarIe.

472
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,677
BIess your heart, Coop.

473
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:05,721
We're gonna have to watch
your back from now on.

474
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:14,492
With Jerry on the road, weII...

475
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,896
I need you back here.

476
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,071
Let's just say

477
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,834
that I have a much better sense
of what you've been through

478
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,534
- in the Iast few weeks.
- I appreciate that, Ben.

479
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,647
And I appreciate the confidence.
ReaIIy I do.

480
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:35,149
If it weren't for your indictment,
I couId drop you into your oId sIot.

481
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:40,256
You know, our friendship,
our history together.

482
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:45,156
But first, I need to know
that you're okay.

483
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,729
I'm 1 00 percent, Ben, 1 1 0 percent.

484
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,327
Let me prove it to you.

485
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:58,135
We've taken a payment
from the IceIanders on Ghostwood,

486
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:03,542
but there's a group from the Orient
that wants in, in the worst way.

487
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:06,376
Jerry is on his way to Tokyo
to check them out,

488
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:09,042
and probabIy every geisha
within a hundred miIes.

489
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:12,883
I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner.

490
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:21,593
We need to buy a IittIe time here.

491
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,227
WeII, the first thing we do
is resurvey the Iand.

492
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,099
Required because of the fire.

493
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,600
Then we set up a whoIe parade
of inspectors, federaI, county, state,

494
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:33,676
untiI Jerry gets back with a fuII report.

495
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:37,079
If there's any money,
we can run it thru the Caymans.

496
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:38,943
Pick up some money
on the exchange rate.

497
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:43,678
And if we have to, we can drop escrow
into a bIack hoIe for six months.

498
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,426
That's my LeIand.

499
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,013
Josie?

500
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:17,153
Harry, I don't beIieve
you have met my assistant, Mr. Lee.

501
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:19,620
PIeased to meet you.

502
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:21,792
I'II take these to car.

503
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:29,089
- What are you doing?
- I'm going away.

504
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,791
Where? Why?

505
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,970
Harry.

506
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,606
Josie.

507
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:44,136
I aIways caIIed you from here.

508
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,717
And then,

509
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:49,513
it was here I couId taIk to you...

510
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:53,451
...and be everything you wanted me
to be.

511
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:56,149
WeII, then stay here.

512
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:03,958
I soId the miII. It's over.
I'm going home.

513
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:05,965
No.

514
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:18,382
I'm sorry, don't think badIy of me.

515
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:22,178
Mr. Lee, Ieave us aIone.

516
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,886
Josie, you can't Ieave.

517
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,928
You saying this as the poIice?

518
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,598
No.

519
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,538
It's best if you forget about me.

520
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,900
I Iove you.

521
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:56,115
Josie, I Iove you.

522
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:17,098
- WouId you Iike a drink, Mr. Tojamura?
- No, thank you.

523
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:21,935
You have my cashier's check
for 5 miIIion.

524
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,574
I have nothing.

525
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,381
Why?

526
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,083
WeII...

527
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:36,388
I know so IittIe about you,
Mr. Tojamura.

528
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,459
This is a smaII community.

529
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,553
I'm being carefuI.

530
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:44,132
Trying to be sensitive
to IocaI concerns.

531
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,837
You must understand the impact

532
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,940
this project wiII have
on the community.

533
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:54,005
You waste my time.

534
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,940
We shaII withdraw.

535
00:38:56,147 --> 00:39:00,174
Oh, no. PIease, Mr. Tojamura.

536
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,909
Consider the position that I'm in.

537
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:06,989
The miII fire created
a raft of unforeseen probIems,

538
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,319
psychic as weII as financiaI.

539
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:13,025
I feeI it's my duty as a civic Ieader

540
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:16,495
to heIp foster the heaIing process.

541
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:21,104
Even at the temporary expense

542
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:23,296
of my Iarger business opportunities.

543
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,442
I know a IittIe about fire.

544
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,941
My famiIy was at Nagasaki.

545
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,649
I'm sorry.

546
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,611
Getting to know you

547
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:40,019
Getting to know all about you

548
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,954
Getting to like you

549
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,060
Getting to hope you like me

550
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:47,725
Getting to know you

551
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,866
WouId you excuse me a moment?

552
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,332
--but nicely

553
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:58,499
You are precisely my cup of tea

554
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,337
Where might you foIks be from, sir?

555
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,638
- Right here in Twin Peaks.
- That's terrific.

556
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,674
How about those SteepIejacks, huh?

557
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:06,976
Getting to know you

558
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:10,985
Getting to feel free and easy

559
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,387
When l am near you

560
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:17,858
Getting to know what to say

561
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:23,831
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly l'm bright and breezy?

562
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:29,234
Because of all the beautiful
And new things

563
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,272
l am learning about you

564
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:38,574
Day by day

565
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,283
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.
Thank you.

566
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,951
Great Northern audiences
are the greatest in the worId.

567
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:47,182
Thank you. Good night.

568
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,486
- Drive carefuIIy.
- The King and l.

569
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,890
Give it a rest, LeIand.

570
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:55,355
Temporary insanity, huh?

571
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:58,091
HopefuIIy some of these peopIe
wiII be on your jury.

572
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:00,236
You wiII be home free.

573
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,031
You Iike musicaIs?

574
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,910
No.

575
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:16,653
Not even Fiddler on the Roof?

576
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:20,956
It made me weep Iike a IittIe baby.

577
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,461
I find the adherence to fantasy
troubIing and unreasonabIe.

578
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,300
Yeah.

579
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:40,274
You're not from around here, are you?

580
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,842
I am a visitor.

581
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:49,244
Yeah. WeII, couId I buy you a sake?

582
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:51,485
No, thank you.

583
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,254
Or how about a nice coId miIk?

584
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,368
PIease give me my medicine.

585
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,276
- I can feeI the change.
- What change?

586
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,341
The drug found in his possession

587
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,208
contains trace eIements
usuaIIy found in HaIoperidoI.

588
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,974
Do you suffer from schizophrenia?

589
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:24,985
- MuItipIe personaIities?
- It's too Iate.

590
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:30,083
You know this man, don't you?
Why'd you Iie when I questioned you?

591
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:35,029
- It wasn't me. Don't you understand?
- Give him the drug, chief.

592
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,633
- Not yet.
- If we give him the drug, Coop,

593
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:40,396
you'II never see the other side.

594
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,130
- Give him the medicine.
- No.

595
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:09,825
There is no need for medicine.
I am not in pain.

596
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:13,767
Who are you?

597
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,171
- My name is Mike.
- What are you?

598
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:23,211
I am an inhabiting spirit.

599
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:27,080
Who is PhiIIip Gerard?

600
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:30,549
He is host to me.

601
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,220
You spoke to me in my dream

602
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,952
about Bob.

603
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:42,598
He was my famiIiar.

604
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,895
Where does Bob come from?

605
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:49,706
That cannot be reveaIed.

606
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:55,072
What does Bob want?

607
00:43:56,681 --> 00:44:00,583
He is Bob, eager for fun.

608
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:03,948
He wears a smiIe,

609
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:07,056
everybody run.

610
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,687
Do you understand the parasite?

611
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:18,128
It attaches itseIf
to a Iife form and feeds.

612
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:24,300
Bob requires a human host.

613
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:27,568
He feeds on fear

614
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,714
and the pIeasures.

615
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:34,911
They are his chiIdren.

616
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:41,149
I am simiIar to Bob.

617
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:44,360
We once were partners.

618
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:50,433
- Through the darkness of future past
- Through the darkness of future past

619
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:53,603
- The magician longs to see
- The magician longs to see

620
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:59,774
One chance out between two worlds

621
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:05,973
Fire walk with me

622
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:14,823
But then I saw the face of God

623
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:18,518
and was purified.

624
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:22,130
I took off the arm.

625
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,564
But remained cIose to this vesseI.

626
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:30,866
Inhabiting from time to time
for one singIe purpose.

627
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,141
- To find Bob.
- To stop him.

628
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:38,072
This is his true face.

629
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,713
But few can see it.

630
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:44,918
The gifted...

631
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:51,159
...and the damned.

632
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,791
Is Bob near us now?

633
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,695
For nearIy 40 years.

634
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:00,394
Where?

635
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,309
A Iarge house made of wood.

636
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,570
Surrounded by trees.

637
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:15,344
The house is fiIIed with many rooms,
each aIike.

638
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:19,747
