1
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,649
- Hey, Donna.
- Hi.

2
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,225
- James, come on in.
- Hi.

3
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,655
We just came
to say goodbye to Maddy.

4
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,230
Oh, I'm sorry, you just missed her.

5
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:09,963
In fact, I dropped her off
at the bus station not 20 minutes ago.

6
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,735
- She's gone?
- Yes.

7
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,938
She thought that you were coming
over Iast night.

8
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:18,875
Did she say anything?

9
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,609
WeII, I wouId have to say that
she was a IittIe bit disappointed.

10
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,451
LeIand?

11
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,653
LeIand, honey?

12
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,321
Excuse me.

13
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:47,967
You know, if you'd Iike,
you couId write her.

14
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,506
I'm sure she'd be gIad
to hear from you.

15
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,406
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
we bothered you.

16
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,548
Hey, no bother, no bother.

17
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,807
- Say hi to your foIks for me, Donna.
- Okay.

18
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,383
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Mr. PaImer.

19
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,554
Bye, James.

20
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,923
- Take it easy now.
- AII right.

21
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,932
- LeIand?
- Yes, dear.

22
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:22,869
Remember to sign us up for
the GIenn MiIIer Night at the cIub.

23
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,442
Don't worry, dear, I won't forget.

24
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:55,568
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, LeIand.

25
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,911
It smeIIs Iike a toiIet in here.
There's nothing...

26
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,323
Jerry, what the heII
took you so Iong?

27
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,491
Gee, dateIines, time zones,
I don't even know where I am.

28
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,927
God, you Iook terribIe.

29
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,470
- Jerry.
- Ben.

30
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,884
WeII, Ben,
since your reguIar mouthpiece

31
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:17,717
has been charged
with murder himseIf,

32
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:22,485
I'm gonna be handIing your case
personaIIy. So Iet's get started.

33
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,060
Did you kiII her?

34
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,969
- Jerry, for God's sakes.
- Sorry, you're right.

35
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:35,130
The Iast thing a good defense attorney
needs to know is the truth.

36
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,905
Jerry, can you get me out of here?

37
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,517
WeII, they can onIy hoId you
for 24 hours without charging you.

38
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:45,810
Or is it 48?

39
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,889
Oh, Jerry, Jerry,
I am in troubIe here.

40
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,822
Under controI, big brother.

41
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:59,590
Okay, so where are we saying
you were on the night Laura died?

42
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:05,227
- I was with Catherine.
- That's not a good choice.

43
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,667
It happens to be the truth.

44
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,775
Oh, dear.

45
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:14,970
Is there any sign of her?
Bone-- Bone fragments or teeth?

46
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:20,277
Charred corroborating note
regarding your whereabouts?

47
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,523
I'm so depressed.

48
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,540
Bunk beds.

49
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,107
Do you remember
our first room, Ben?

50
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,542
Me on the top bunk
and you on the bottom bunk.

51
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,583
And Louise Dombrowski dancing
on the hook rug with a fIashIight.

52
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,197
Lord, what's become of us?

53
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:25,410
You know, the first time I went in,

54
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:29,343
they thought it was my bIadder,
so they checked it again.

55
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,508
It was an infection.
I hadn't even been near a rusty naiI.

56
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,484
I mean, you remember that time
my toe turned purpIe, right?

57
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:40,353
So instead, I took a bath in baking
soda and then my toe came around,

58
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,857
but I got the worst cramps

59
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,053
Iike I swaIIowed
a kinked hose or something.

60
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,561
Have you seen Andy?

61
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:52,262
Oh, you must be that native person
I've heard so much about, EagIe Eye?

62
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,406
Hawk. Sister?

63
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,009
Oh, yeah, this is my sister Gwen.
This is Hawk.

64
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,236
Oh, it's a pIeasure to meet you.

65
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:04,746
God, how you must hate us white
peopIe after aII we've done to you.

66
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,943
Some of my best friends
are white peopIe.

67
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:13,558
Anyway, oh, come on.
My stomach...

68
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,923
Diane, 1 0:03 a.m.,
Great Northern HoteI.

69
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,155
Sheriff Truman and I have just been
with the one-armed man,

70
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,061
or what's Ieft of him.

71
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,860
In another time, another cuIture,

72
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,597
he may have been
a seer, a shaman priest.

73
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:30,572
In our worId, he's a shoe saIesman
and Iives among the shadows.

74
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,957
LeIand PaImer.

75
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,491
Excuse me.

76
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,328
Does he know
we arrested Ben Horne?

77
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,899
Doesn't Iook Iike it.

78
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,910
Harry, best if he'd hear it from you.

79
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:18,346
Hi, Harry, Agent Cooper.
Just having a IittIe fun.

80
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,790
You're Iooking good, LeIand.

81
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,962
Just caII me Fred.

82
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,462
LeIand, I'm sorry.

83
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:31,728
We didn't want you
to hear it from anyone eIse.

84
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,963
We've arrested Ben Horne
for Laura's murder.

85
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,803
He hasn't been charged,
but we're hoIding him.

86
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,314
- Ben?
- That's right.

87
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,012
There must be
some mistake, Harry.

88
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,878
Ben?

89
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:51,153
- I thought that Jacques RenauIt had--
- No.

90
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:54,886
Ben.

91
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,996
- You have a strong case against him?
- Yes, we do.

92
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,165
Oh, God.

93
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,992
WiII you be aII right, LeIand?

94
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,271
Yeah.

95
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:12,007
- The Iaw wiII handIe this.
- As it shouId be.

96
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,477
Thanks, Harry. Agent Cooper.

97
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,940
Harry, I'II catch up with you.

98
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,424
LeIand?

99
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:11,227
Yes.

100
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:16,102
If you can remember anything unusuaI
about Mr. Horne's behavior

101
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,369
the night of Laura's death,
wouId you pIease Iet me know?

102
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,580
I wiII, of course.

103
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,441
Thank you.

104
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,630
Everything okay?

105
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,635
I'm not sure.

106
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:22,904
This won't hurt a bit.

107
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,709
Sheriff, I protest this brutaI treatment
of my cIient.

108
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,472
After aII this man
has done for this town...

109
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,548
Now, hoId stiII.

110
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,328
I'II have the resuIts
in a coupIe of hours.

111
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,622
- Thanks, doc.
- GentIemen,

112
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:49,358
I demand that my cIient
either be reIeased or charged.

113
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:53,198
Never in aII my years of practicing Iaw
have I witnessed such a compIete

114
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,342
and utter disregard for
an accused man's constitutionaI rights.

115
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:02,310
Jeremy Horne,
Gonzaga University, 1 97 4.

116
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,575
Graduated Iast in his cIass of 1 42.

117
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,714
Passed the bar on his third attempt.

118
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,013
License to practice
revoked in the states

119
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,056
of IIIinois, FIorida,
AIaska, Massachusetts.

120
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,990
Hey, I'm not on triaI here.

121
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,686
Sit down.

122
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,330
Mr. Horne, do you know what this is?

123
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,828
- A book.
- A book.

124
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,904
Take a cIoser Iook.

125
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,880
A diary.

126
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,543
We aII know about One-Eyed Jack's.

127
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,185
So did Laura.

128
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,256
''Someday, I'm gonna teII the worId
aII about Ben Horne.

129
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,021
I'm gonna teII them who he reaIIy is.''

130
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,395
She never got the chance, did she?

131
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:06,875
Come on, Ben, we're aII aduIts here.

132
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,750
WiId, young girI Iike Laura PaImer,
things spin out of controI.

133
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:17,889
She becomes a threat not just to you,
but to your business, your famiIy.

134
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,718
You are way out of Iine.

135
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,653
WeII, maybe
you don't have anything to hide.

136
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,098
That's not what it says in here.

137
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,564
- You cannot taIk to me Iike this!
- Ben. Ben.

138
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,726
- You cannot, you understand?
- Sit down.

139
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:35,930
Nice and easy. GentIemen, I'd Iike
a moment aIone with my brother--

140
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,769
With my cIient.

141
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,075
If you don't mind?

142
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,246
You have your moment.

143
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,157
Ben, Ben.

144
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,657
Ben, if you're gonna bIurt out
a confession Iike that,

145
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,455
it's gonna make our options
shrink down to a tiny IittIe nub.

146
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,292
AII right, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

147
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,600
Your aIibi has been roasted.

148
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,101
They can estabIish motive.

149
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:10,003
And your bIood
may have Laura's fingerprints on it.

150
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,378
Ben, as your attorney,

151
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:22,109
your friend, and your brother,

152
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:28,592
I strongIy suggest
that you get yourseIf a better Iawyer.

153
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:38,330
Okay, one last chance, Leo.
Don't disappoint me.

154
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,129
The mill?

155
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:52,077
Okay, one last chance, Leo.
Don't disappoint me.

156
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,843
The mill?

157
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,418
Keep it simple.

158
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,418
lnsurance investigators
should read ''arson. ''

159
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,354
Block letters about 6 feet high.

160
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,757
The deal as we discussed?

161
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,029
Ben Horne, his voice,

162
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:15,435
and Johnson's voice, Ben and Leo.

163
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,905
SpeciaI deIivery for Mr. Horne.

164
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:31,590
Bobby. Oh, God. Bobby!

165
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,163
He did it again.

166
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,599
It's your turn to cIean him this time.

167
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,735
What's that?

168
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:54,676
That is our ship.

169
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,412
What's that mean?

170
00:18:56,882 --> 00:19:01,717
Since our cash cow in the other room
has turned into a sinkhoIe,

171
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:05,948
I've decided to pursue a career
in business.

172
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,217
ReaIIy? Like a saIesman?

173
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:13,262
Oh, no, I'm thinking
more executive suite.

174
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:14,933
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

175
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,659
Bobby, that sounds great.

176
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:22,797
I'm gonna give you
anything you want.

177
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:27,576
I want a fuII-time nanny.

178
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:34,977
- Maybe a French maid.
- Bobby.

179
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:48,731
- HeIIo, Norma.
- Mother.

180
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:51,528
I trust those are reaI potatoes
and not fIakes?

181
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,465
ReaI potatoes.

182
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,269
Excuse me.

183
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:01,111
What a nice surprise to see you here.

184
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,838
Hey, those are good.

185
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,745
I see they taught
him a skiII in the stockade.

186
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:09,352
- Where is your charming husband?
- Hank? He's not here right now.

187
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,312
I see.

188
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:15,286
Mother, I got your message.
But if you don't mind my asking,

189
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,519
what are you doing here?

190
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,832
I want to introduce you
to my new husband.

191
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,498
Husband?

192
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:26,671
Ernie, this is Norma.

193
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,363
Hi, how are you?

194
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,533
We're honeymooning.

195
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:36,079
I wonder if I couId
bother you for a cup of coffee?

196
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,916
- Nice girI.
- She's darIing.

197
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,782
Ernie's a financiaI anaIyst.

198
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,920
I just Iove what you've done
with your diner, darIing.

199
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,526
The fIowers add
such a measure of cheer.

200
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:54,191
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

201
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:59,429
Nice to see those good Iooks haven't
isoIated themseIves to one generation.

202
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,738
- Yeah, I know, go with goId figures.
- Excuse me.

203
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,046
You stiII Iook very smart
in that uniform.

204
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:11,312
Your figure's IoveIy.
It hasn't changed.

205
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,042
Now, I don't mean to be rude,
but how Iong wiII you be staying?

206
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:19,584
A coupIe of days. Ernie wanted
to see something of the country.

207
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:21,258
Why?

208
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,623
I just wish I had known, that's aII.

209
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,957
Oh, I didn't mean for you
to go into any fuss.

210
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,532
You know me, dear, I'm easy.

211
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,397
What's wrong?

212
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:34,437
Nothing, it's just that
there's a food critic coming

213
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,871
and I'm short on heIp, that's aII.

214
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,976
Food critic.

215
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:43,378
So that's why you tried so hard
to make the pIace Iook nice.

216
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:47,950
Norma, hoping to spend
much more time with you.

217
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,049
If it's aII right, we'd better check in.

218
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:53,282
I've got a Tokyo fax
waiting for me at the desk.

219
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:55,585
We'II be at the Great Northern.

220
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:59,491
I'm sorry we missed Henry.
I'II caII you Iater, okay?

221
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:03,065
Okay. Nice to meet you.

222
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:31,829
He's cIose.

223
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,801
Nurse.

224
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,931
CouId I have
a gIass of water, pIease?

225
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,765
Yes, sir.

226
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,859
I'm sorry.

227
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,310
Hi, Norma.

228
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,680
I guess I'm a IittIe Iate.

229
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,216
Forty-eight hours is not Iate, Hank,
it's missing.

230
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:33,914
I'm sorry, it was some--
Some business I had to take care of.

231
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,254
Business? No, this is business.

232
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:40,056
Business is a pIace where you come to
whether you feeI Iike it or not.

233
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,394
- Norma, I--
- Don't sweet-taIk me,

234
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,230
I'm this far from teIIing you
to take a hike.

235
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,770
Norma, pIease don't make that
kind of judgment untiI you hear me out.

236
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,035
Because of the bad choices
I've made,

237
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:54,876
there are peopIe out there,

238
00:23:56,014 --> 00:24:00,246
peopIe from my past
who wanna see me faiI.

239
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,851
I've tried fighting them,
but I just get in more troubIe.

240
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:08,425
I've tried running from them,
but there's aIways somebody faster.

241
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,427
I know it's no way for a man
to Iive his Iife,

242
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,761
but sometimes it's just best

243
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:20,394
to hoId up and wait
for the storm to pass.

244
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,605
I didn't mean to hurt you.

245
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:29,879
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water.

246
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:38,021
Maybe next time,
you'II ask for a IittIe heIp.

247
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:42,958
Next time, I wiII.

248
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,397
WeII, the prodigaI son returns.

249
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,067
- Vivian.
- Hi.

250
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,296
- You Iook great.
- Thanks.

251
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:56,736
Prison treat you weII?

252
00:24:57,242 --> 00:25:00,643
WeII, that's a Iong story.

253
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:03,940
I'd Iike to hear it over dinner tonight.
I have a new husband.

254
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:07,752
- Great Northern, 8:30?
- We'd Iove to.

255
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,253
- I don't think if I'II be abIe to get there.
- We'II be fine, honey.

256
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,152
Eight-thirty sharp, we'II be there.

257
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,291
- Harry?
- Oh, heIIo, Pete.

258
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:25,299
What you got?

259
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,971
Woodpecker.

260
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:31,069
PiIeated, I think.

261
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,841
Yeah. Here.

262
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:42,181
PiIeated woodpecker.

263
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,483
Outstanding.

264
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:48,725
Harry?

265
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:51,125
Yeah, Pete.

266
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:55,656
Harry, Josie's gone.

267
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,864
Yeah, I know.

268
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,206
When I came home
from the Iate shift,

269
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:06,867
she Ieft a note on the kitchen tabIe,
no expIanations, no goodbyes.

270
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,739
A note.

271
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:12,112
She soId the miII to Ben Horne.

272
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,586
WeII, not exactIy.

273
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,154
You don't have to expIain.

274
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:24,659
I Ioved her.

275
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,399
There. I said it.

276
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,165
No offense, Harry.

277
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:35,397
I Ioved her too.

278
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,238
I stood there and watched her go.
Watched her assistant

279
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:41,709
carry her bags away.

280
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,712
Her assistant?

281
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,180
Yeah, Asian feIIow.
Never saw him before.

282
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:48,911
What did he Iook Iike?

283
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,948
Average height,
medium buiId, ponytaiI.

284
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,557
Oh, that was her cousin, Jonathan.

285
00:26:56,261 --> 00:27:00,027
She said it was her assistant,
Mr. Lee.

286
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,663
Mr. Lee?

287
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:11,436
Harry, I have a bad feeIing.

288
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:16,311
- I'm right there with you, Pete.
- Harry.

289
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:19,949
HeIIo, Pete. Gerard's missing.
He knocked the deputy out.

290
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,685
Pete, you'II have to excuse us.

291
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,296
He don't get far.

292
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:37,094
Hi, sheriff. Agent Cooper.

293
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,776
Lucy?

294
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,087
- Lucy?
- What?

295
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,165
Andy?

296
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:28,485
Step right in, Pete.

297
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,656
We desperate criminaIs
are Iocked safeIy in our cages.

298
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:34,052
I have a message for you.

299
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:38,320
Greetings from the boys
down at the miII?

300
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,797
But first, a IittIe music.

301
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:51,837
Hello, Benjamin.

302
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,811
Oh, l'm sorry l haven't
dropped by for a visit, dear.

303
00:28:57,015 --> 00:29:00,542
But l have a strong aversion
to prisons.

304
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,486
- How awful--
- She's aIive?

305
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,218
The night we spent together
lost in love.

306
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:14,325
When was that?
lt seems so long ago.

307
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:16,899
Almost like a dream.

308
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:22,365
Oh, yes, l remember,
it was the night Laura Palmer died.

309
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:27,235
Memory is so unreliable finally,
maybe it was a dream.

310
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,846
Maybe it never happened.

311
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:33,951
To tell you the truth,
l can't be sure anymore.

312
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:38,019
What does she want? I'II pay anything.
What does she want?

313
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,050
You okay there, Benji?

314
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,920
ln exchange for my testimony, dear,

315
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:47,189
you will sign the mill and
Ghostwood Estates back over to me.

316
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,563
l will consider letting you keep
your precious hotel.

317
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,567
A representative of mine
will come to you

318
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,039
with the documents within 2 4 hours.

319
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,939
lf you won't cooperate...

320
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:04,708
Well, l'm confident
that you'll go on from here

321
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:08,319
to excel in one or another
of the many fine career opportunities

322
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,580
offered by the federal
prison system.

323
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,551
Ben, so nice to see you again.

324
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,622
She set me up.

325
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,663
That Catherine.

326
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:29,899
She set me up.

327
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:34,233
She's a cautioned, isn't she?

328
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,029
You set me up!
You bitch! You bitch!

329
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,829
I'II get you, you bitch.

330
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,684
Set me up.

331
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,793
Set me up.

332
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,660
Chicks and ducks and geese
Better scurry

333
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:31,199
When l take you out in the surrey

334
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:37,500
When l take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top

335
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:51,711
When l take you out in the surrey

336
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,420
When l take you out in the surrey

337
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:59,724
With the fringe on top

338
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:04,265
Harry, are driver education programs
mandatory in your schooI system?

339
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:06,400
Yep.

340
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,764
I think we got a dropout.
Harry, Iook out.

341
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,397
With the fringe on top

342
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,205
LeIand.

343
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:48,508
Agent Cooper, Harry, I'm sorry.

344
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,644
- Are you two aII right?
- LeIand, we're fine. How about you?

345
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:54,010
Oh, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine.

346
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:57,780
I was just on my way to the cIub
to try out a new set of irons,

347
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:02,325
and I must have started
thinking about Ben.

348
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:04,422
I guess my mind just wandered.

349
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:07,759
It's a good idea to Ieave your troubIes
at home when operating a vehicIe.

350
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,799
You're right, of course.
My apoIogies.

351
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:18,837
I did remember something, as
you asked, about the night Laura died.

352
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:22,576
I was working Iate at the office
with Ben, it was about 1 0:00.

353
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,510
He Ieft the room
to make a phone caII.

354
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:29,620
I don't know who he was taIking to, but
his voice was raised, he was angry.

355
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,754
I heard him mention
something about

356
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,353
a dairy.

357
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,118
- A dairy?
- That's what I think, yes.

358
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,491
- A diary.
- That couId be it.

359
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,496
Sheriff Truman, Sheriff Truman,
this is Lucy.

360
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:46,194
Are you there, sheriff?
l have an urgent message from Hawk.

361
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:51,032
- Do you pIay goIf, Agent Cooper?
- Yes, LeIand, I enjoy its precision.

362
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:53,677
I'd Iike to invite you for a round
at the cIub someday.

363
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:57,576
May I show you my new cIubs?

364
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,649
Sure.

365
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,085
Cooper.

366
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:10,356
They found Gerard.
Near the waterfaII.

367
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,496
Better go. They're waiting for us.

368
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,668
Let's go get him. LeIand,
we'II see those cIubs another time.

369
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:20,201
I understand, Agent Cooper.
You Iet me know

370
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:23,603
- if there's anything I can do to heIp.
- WiII do.

371
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:02,276
Poor Andy.

372
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,914
You know, the exact same thing
happened to me

373
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,550
when I first got pregnant.

374
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,082
I wouId be out shopping,

375
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,949
and then boom, pass right out
in the produce section.

376
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,725
Then come to covered in bruises
and crushed fruit,

377
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:19,090
and strangers standing over me
waiting to see if I was dead.

378
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:23,097
You see, peopIe want terribIe things
to happen to you, I know.

379
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:29,104
I wanna taIk to you
about my sperms.

380
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:32,538
Sperms?
You know, that is aII men think about.

381
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,368
You know, I remember
when IittIe CarI was first born

382
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,242
and they Iaid him out on my breast,

383
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,146
I Iooked down and saw what kind of
a tiny IittIe creature I was deaIing with.

384
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:47,781
And I thought to myseIf, I thought,
''My God, just what the worId needs,

385
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:53,555
another sperm gun running around
Ioose. Right? Women beware.''

386
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,301
WeII, I did.

387
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:05,469
I had mine counted twice.
The first time, they were aII dead.

388
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,807
Oh, man, if I had a nickeI
every time I heard that one.

389
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,108
- Second time, they were jumping Iike--
- What? What?

390
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,310
--Iike saImon swimming upstream.

391
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:20,617
So, of course,
aII you couId think of was spawning.

392
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,490
- Shut up.
- Shut up, Gwen.

393
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:36,439
So when you toId me that you were
pregnant, I didn't think it couId be me

394
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:40,634
because mine were aII dead
supposedIy at the time.

395
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,274
But they got better.
I was misinformed. I'm the father.

396
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:52,187
Oh, brother.

397
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,185
Aren't I?

398
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:59,261
Oh, yeah. Oh, come here.

399
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:03,332
You want to see
your mean Aunt Lucy.

400
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:10,263
Oh, aren't you neat,
you IittIe snooky-bookems.

401
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:25,087
He's been cIose.

402
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,493
Bob is not here now.

403
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:32,858
Sheriff. Sheriff?

404
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:36,697
Isn't there something
that you'd Iike to share with us?

405
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,799
Oh, great.

406
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:43,706
And wouId you teII this guy to stop
staring at me Iike I'm a dog biscuit.

407
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:47,436
Bob has been very cIose.

408
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,943
Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob.

409
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:51,580
Do we know a Bob?

410
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:56,844
Sheriff, no offense, but cIearIy,
this man's stairs do not reach the attic.

411
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,921
Now, your 24 hours are up.

412
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:01,751
You either charge my cIient
or Iet him go!

413
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:10,098
Ben Horne, I'm charging you
with the murder of Laura PaImer.

414
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:14,033
Yeah. Good move, Jer.

415
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:17,605
Hawk, take Mr. Gerard
back to the hoteI.

416
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,969
- NaiI aII the windows shut.
- No. No.

417
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:23,636
- I want two men on the door.
- You two-bit Iumberjack.

418
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,111
- You are finished in this town.
- Don't make it worse.

419
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,376
You're finished.

420
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:32,411
- CaIm down. What are you doing?
- Step outside, pIease?

421
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,153
I'm aII right.

422
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:41,389
Harry. Harry, I think we're saddIing
the horse before we're ready to ride.

423
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,897
I don't foIIow.

424
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,331
I don't think Ben Horne
kiIIed Laura PaImer.

425
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:48,097
- What?
- You shouId reIease him.

426
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,739
Cooper?

427
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:53,604
I've backed you every step of the way.
I've had enough of the mumbo jumbo.

428
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:57,373
I've had enough of the dreams,
the visions, the dwarfs, the giants,

429
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,482
Tibet and the rest
of the hocus-pocus.

430
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,745
Now, we've got hard evidence
against Ben Horne.

431
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,115
It's my job to Iock him up.

432
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,351
You're right, Harry.
This is your back yard.

433
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:11,154
Sometimes an outsider
can forget that.

434
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:24,203
WeII, the saImon was fresh and firm
and just a IittIe bit overdone.

435
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:27,134
- Mine too.
- Just right.

436
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,205
WouId you excuse me
for a minute, pIease?

437
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,145
I'II join you.

438
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,278
Ladies, hurry back.

439
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,337
You're not gonna say anything,
are you?

440
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,308
If Vivian ever found out
I'd been inside she'd--

441
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,206
She'd drop me fIat.

442
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,247
I Iike your new hair coIor.

443
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:08,349
Ernie NiIes.

444
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,885
Ernie ''The Professor'' NiIes.

445
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,688
- So when did you?
- A coupIe of weeks ago.

446
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,382
Let me teII you, Ernie,

447
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:20,361
without you in there to paI around with
the Iast six months were sheer heII.

448
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,260
Nobody to go to the Iibrary with.

449
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,595
Nobody to stamp out
Iicense pIates with.

450
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:30,271
So, what's your angIe here
with Miss Moneybags?

451
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:31,873
No angIe.

452
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,068
Come on, buddy,
we don't have any secrets.

453
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,179
Vivian's roIIing in dough.

454
00:40:36,614 --> 00:40:39,742
I met Vivian
at a RepubIican fundraiser.

455
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,747
We're married.

456
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,914
You must have toId her
some taII taIe, a whopper.

457
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:49,116
I'm trying very hard to teII nothing
but the truth these days.

458
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:52,091
It's therapeutic.

459
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:57,364
And Vivian wants me to handIe
aII her investments.

460
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,734
What about yours?
Introduce her to your Ioan shark?

461
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:06,035
I'm out of it, I'm out of it, Hank.
I don't gambIe anymore.

462
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:09,407
I go to meetings. I go to church too.

463
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,912
So, what happens when
Vivian finds out that you ran off

464
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,814
- with the congregation's picnic fund?
- I never stoIe from a church.

465
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:18,521
It was a savings and Ioan.

466
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,081
I was sick, it was an iIIness.
I paid my debt.

467
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,456
It's a new Iife, a cIean-- CIean sIate.

468
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,256
- So she reaIIy doesn't know?
- No.

469
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,762
WeII, Ernie, this is interesting to me.

470
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:37,572
Because famiIy is the most
important thing in the worId to me.

471
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:42,176
One must be prepared
to pay any price to protect it.

472
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,040
Don't you agree?

473
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,749
Oh, yeah, yeah. I compIeteIy agree.

474
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:51,949
We'II taIk more Iater, Ernie.

475
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:54,249
I've aIways enjoyed
our taIks in the yard,

476
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,985
man-to-man, prisoner-to-prisoner.

477
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:00,455
- We're back.
- Ladies.

478
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:08,329
I wouId Iike to propose a toast

479
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:11,838
to the newIyweds
and their happiness.

480
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:14,271
Thank you, Henry.
It's very generous.

481
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:17,141
To Ernie and Vivian,

482
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:22,616
to much success in their future
and aII their future deaIings.

483
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,515
How sweet.

484
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:26,786
That's sweet.

485
00:42:56,721 --> 00:43:02,057
Diane, it's 1 1 :05 p.m. I'm in my room
at the Great Northern HoteI.

486
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:05,159
There's not a star in the sky tonight.

487
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:07,661
Ben Horne is in custody.

488
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,190
The traiI narrows, Diane.

489
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:11,493
I'm very cIose,

490
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:15,537
but the Iast few steps are aIways
the darkest and most difficuIt.

491
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:36,050
- Hi.
- Audrey?

492
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,559
- Can I come in and taIk?
- AII right.

493
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:44,457
- Is that where you got shot?
- Yeah.

494
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:49,071
Did you arrest him?

495
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:53,099
Yeah.

496
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:55,902
Did he do it?

497
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,677
That's for a court to decide.

498
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,574
What do you think?

499
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:04,214
What I think
doesn't reaIIy matter right now.

500
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:06,982
Did you arrest him
because of what I said?

501
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:08,623
OnIy in part.

502
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:11,056
But it heIped?

503
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,194
Yeah.

504
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:18,764
AII I ever reaIIy wanted
was for him to Iove me.

505
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:21,762
I'm sure that he does.

506
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:25,101
He's ashamed of me.

507
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:26,774
No, he's not.

508
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:36,852
Agent Cooper,

509
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:42,149
when I was at One-Eyed Jack's,
I never, never Iet anyone--

510
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:45,318
Audrey, you don't have
to say anything.

511
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,154
I want you to know.

512
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:48,992
I know.

513
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,042
I have to get that.

514
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:01,170
Okay.

515
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:10,618
Cooper here. Where?

516
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:14,786
How Iong ago?

517
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:18,126
- I'm on my way.
- What's wrong?

518
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:20,229
I want you to go to your room
and Iock the door.

519
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:23,367
- Why?
- No questions, do what I say.

520
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,364
AII right.

521
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:14,948
It's Maddy Ferguson.
