1
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,021
Good Lord.

2
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,864
Andy,

3
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,565
I want this dusted for prints.

4
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,108
No one saw a thing.

5
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,271
The bIackout and the fire
drew everyone out of the buiIding.

6
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,876
- How Iong has he been dead?
- It's hard to say.

7
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,541
We'II need an autopsy.

8
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,815
Doc, if you Iift up the victim's shirt,
I beIieve you'II find a stab wound,

9
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,582
one inch beneath the sternum,

10
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,126
penetrating upwards,
severing the aorta.

11
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:39,633
You've seen this before.

12
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,767
- Yeah.
- Any traces?

13
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,776
No bIood stains.

14
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,311
What's this?

15
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,622
- DougIas fir, Harry?
- LodgepoIe pine.

16
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,853
Hawk, footprints?

17
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:04,463
Two sets, same boots,
one coming, one Ieaving.

18
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,656
Heavier impressions
on the way down.

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,494
Carrying the body.

20
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:12,798
Coop, are you sure
Windom EarIe's behind this?

21
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:23,810
A short time ago, a vagrant,

22
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,976
our victim, was befriended
and offered a Iift.

23
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,712
He was driven to a Iocation
up beyond the ridge.

24
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,883
The car wiII stiII be there.
He was stabbed once.

25
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,461
He managed to run a short distance
before coIIapsing.

26
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,632
Windom EarIe
engineered the expIosion

27
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,563
that caused the power outage.

28
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,206
He created a diversionary fire
that drew everyone out of the station.

29
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:50,207
Brought the body in
through this window.

30
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:55,177
Windom EarIe
has been in this room.

31
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,982
I can stiII feeI his presence.

32
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:02,150
Harry, we're not gonna find
any fingerprints in here.

33
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:05,382
No mistakes. No sIip-ups.

34
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,823
Everything has its own rationaIe,

35
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,986
precision, inteIIigence.

36
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,499
Windom EarIe is a genius.

37
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:19,071
And he's taken his first pawn
in a very sick game.

38
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:38,885
Listen carefuIIy, Bobby Briggs.
This is what we're gonna do.

39
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:42,290
If there's one thing I Iearned from
my father before he fIipped his wig,

40
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:46,296
it's that a business reIationship
is Iike a sacred pact.

41
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,629
EquaIed onIy by the cIosest
of personaI reIationships,

42
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:53,033
where nothing is heId back.

43
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:54,901
Right.

44
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,108
Do you wanna get rich, Bobby?

45
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:04,782
- ImmediateIy.
- WeII, maybe I can heIp.

46
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,945
Let's pretend that this is my father.

47
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,956
- An ice cube?
- Right.

48
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:17,460
And our job now is to heIp
my father come back from Iimbo Iand

49
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:23,228
before he meIts away and Ieaves us
with a handfuI of nothing.

50
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:28,505
We wouIdn't want that to happen,
wouId we?

51
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,233
No.

52
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:37,405
So from now on, Bobby,
I'm the one you suck up to.

53
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,111
- What about SheIIy?
- What about SheIIy?

54
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,427
Leo.

55
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,337
Leo?

56
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,525
Leo?

57
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,036
No.

58
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:42,339
No.

59
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,344
HeIp me!

60
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,885
PIease! HeIp me!

61
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,655
No! No!

62
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,090
Leo? PIease.

63
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,390
Bad girI.

64
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,501
PIease, pIease don't.

65
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,282
No!

66
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,118
I swear. I'II kiII you.

67
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:13,333
HeIp me! HeIp!

68
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,113
SheIIy?

69
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,054
SheIIy.

70
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,652
SheIIy, come on.

71
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,790
No. No!

72
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,603
- No!
- SheIIy?

73
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:52,608
No, no, Leo.

74
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,076
SheIIy!

75
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:56,641
- SheIIy!
- No, pIease.

76
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,109
- No!
- Leo, you bastard!

77
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,783
Goodbye, wife.

78
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,025
SheIIy.

79
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:14,200
Leo!

80
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,493
Goodbye.

81
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:01,441
Bobby! Bobby.

82
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,851
Everything's okay, baby.

83
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,919
He's gone.

84
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:54,889
- Here.
- Thanks, Harry.

85
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,935
WeII, no fibers, no prints.
You were right.

86
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:02,006
If it is EarIe, he didn't miss a beat.

87
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,438
Did you hear anything from Denise?

88
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:10,104
The Bureau and the DEA cIeared me
of aII criminaI charges.

89
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,183
The suspension stiII stands.

90
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,912
I'm waiting to hear from Gordon.

91
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:18,455
In the meantime,
you're stiII my deputy.

92
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,928
If you want this case, it's yours.

93
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:28,596
Harry, I want it.

94
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,763
Harry.

95
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,467
I found that car on the Iogging road
just Iike you said.

96
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,201
No prints.

97
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,314
And just so you know, Hank Jennings
didn't make the buy at Dead Dog

98
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,507
because he was in the hospitaI.

99
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,118
CIaims he was hit by a bus.

100
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,518
I cuffed him to the bed
and booked him for paroIe vioIations.

101
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,856
SheIIy Johnson caIIed.

102
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,655
She said Leo came to Iast night,

103
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,957
attacked her
and ran off into the woods.

104
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,864
HoIy smokes.

105
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,857
Lucy, we need to taIk.
It's about Nicky.

106
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,494
LittIe Nicky?

107
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,427
Dick and I have been doing
some thinking and some Iooking,

108
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,194
and we think he's a-- He's a--

109
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,903
A what?

110
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,243
We think he murdered his parents.

111
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:51,349
- He's 9 years oId.
- I know.

112
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:56,253
We think he was 6
at the time of the crime.

113
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,017
I met IittIe Nicky.
I've taIked to IittIe Nicky.

114
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,225
If you two think for one second

115
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,095
that I'II beIieve that a defenseIess
IittIe orphan is capabIe of murder,

116
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:13,466
the both of you aren't fit
to be fathers to a chimp.

117
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,541
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
right away.

118
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:49,807
HeIIo, you must be James.

119
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:52,239
I'm Jeffrey Marsh.

120
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,403
I've been hearing very good things
about your work from EveIyn.

121
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,243
WeII, you'II see how it is
when you take it out.

122
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,477
I'm sure it wiII be fine.
It's Iucky we found you.

123
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,814
No, my Iuck.

124
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,288
I hear you were on the road.

125
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,517
Yeah, I wiII be soon.

126
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:13,461
No itinerary, no deadIines. I'm envious.
Wish I was going with you.

127
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,929
Maybe after I take her for a spin,
we'II taIk shop.

128
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,769
Sounds Iike we have a mutuaI Iove:

129
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,444
Cars.

130
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,478
Yeah, weII,
actuaIIy I'm kind of overdue as it is.

131
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,478
Of course he'II stay.

132
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,847
There are pIenty of things
I couId find for him to do.

133
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,950
Right, James?

134
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,882
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

135
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,924
Excuse me.

136
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,697
- Nice kid.
- He's done a fine job on the car.

137
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,562
Let's see what it wiII do
on the open road.

138
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,635
Goodbye, Jeffrey.

139
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,224
Doc, it's Nadine I wanna taIk about.

140
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,659
Nadine wants to start dating boys

141
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,265
and I don't know what to say.

142
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:25,500
Is she sexuaIIy active?

143
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,935
Active?

144
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:32,066
Doc, I wake up every morning feeIing
Iike I've been hit by a timber truck.

145
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,675
It's the extra adrenaIine.

146
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,850
WeII, it's downright dangerous.

147
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:42,476
She's IiabIe to kiII a young kid.
I don't know what to say.

148
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,989
Be patient.

149
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,852
And teII her to be home
by 9:00 on schooI nights.

150
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,134
Extra potatoes.

151
00:15:58,537 --> 00:15:59,765
WeII, thanks.

152
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,745
Ed, Donna took the van
this morning.

153
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,383
Said something
about Iooking for James.

154
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,417
Is there anything
I need to worry about?

155
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:19,080
WeII, James is out west
a coupIe of hours.

156
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:22,819
Trying to cIear his head, I think.
Donna's taking him some money.

157
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,629
Not easy being a parent, is it?

158
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,790
Boy, I'II say.

159
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,733
WeII...

160
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,134
- See you, Ed.
- Thanks, doc.

161
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,347
Hank's in the hospitaI.

162
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,485
He said a tree feII on him.

163
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:51,181
Honey, that tree was a redwood
caIIed Nadine.

164
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,257
Yesterday after you Ieft,
Hank jumped me.

165
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,950
Right in my own Iiving room.

166
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,090
If Nadine hadn't shown up...

167
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,060
Nadine took out Hank?

168
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,567
And it wasn't pretty.

169
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:07,671
Harry caIIed. He said he'II be arresting
Hank for paroIe vioIation.

170
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,274
When Hank gets weII,
he may have to go back to prison.

171
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:14,808
I think it's time I start correcting
a few of the mistakes I've made.

172
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:19,944
WeII, we couId start
by getting a cabin.

173
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,988
A coupIe of venison steaks
and a bottIe of sparkIing wine.

174
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,454
PeopIe wiII find out.

175
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,521
Let them.

176
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,876
- Don't you knock?
- I'm sorry.

177
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,544
- Are you Ieaving?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:01,255
You were good with Jeffrey.

179
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,725
It didn't feeI that good.

180
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:09,557
I can change that.

181
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,840
It's wrong.

182
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,438
Love isn't wrong, James.

183
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,445
PIease don't Ieave me.

184
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,843
Don't Ieave me aIone with him.

185
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,222
What a shot!

186
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:44,869
I'm gonna go check my bike.

187
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,221
So how does chess
figure into aII this?

188
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:17,260
Because Windom EarIe and I pIayed
a game every day for three years.

189
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,632
He feIt that aII of Iife

190
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:23,434
couId be found in the patterns
and confIicts on the board.

191
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,944
Because I never beat him.

192
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,512
Now it's my turn.

193
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:36,777
I'II pubIish my response
in the Twin Peaks Gazette.

194
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,424
I don't know what eIse to do.

195
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:44,327
Coop, you're gonna have to give me
some more information here.

196
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,928
Harry, I've brought some baggage
to town I haven't toId you about.

197
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,671
Windom EarIe was my first partner.

198
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:02,442
Everything I know about the Iaw
and the Bureau, I owe to him.

199
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,506
Four years ago,
we drew the assignment

200
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:09,051
of protecting a materiaI witness
in a federaI crime.

201
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:16,288
She was a very beautifuI,
very gentIe woman.

202
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,729
Her name was CaroIine.

203
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,265
She and I feII in Iove.

204
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:32,369
One night, I faiIed in my vigiIance.

205
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,037
An attack was made. I wasn't ready.

206
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:39,210
I was wounded
and I Iost consciousness.

207
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:43,583
When I came to,
she was in my arms.

208
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,724
She was dead.
She'd been stabbed.

209
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,721
The wounds on the vagrant?

210
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,596
IdenticaI.

211
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,265
The kiIIer was never found.

212
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:01,668
My wound heaIed,
Windom EarIe went mad.

213
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,434
InstitutionaIized
untiI his recent escape.

214
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:07,103
So why is he after you?

215
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,411
Harry,

216
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,846
CaroIine was Windom EarIe's wife.

217
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:25,090
So he bIames you for her death.

218
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,467
It's much worse than that.

219
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,137
I think he kiIIed her.

220
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,934
And I think he committed the crime
that she originaIIy witnessed.

221
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:45,607
Harry, Windom EarIe's mind
is Iike a diamond.

222
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:50,278
It's coId and hard and briIIiant.

223
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,325
I think he feigned the insanity
that sent him away.

224
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:57,087
But at some point,
he Iost the abiIity to distinguish

225
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:00,231
between what's right
and what's wrong.

226
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,468
You don't know
what he's capabIe of, Harry.

227
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,797
You don't know.

228
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:31,489
Coffee, pIease.

229
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,105
I'm Iooking for a biker
named James.

230
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,278
You Iook Iike someone
in need of heIp.

231
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:02,524
I'm Iooking for someone.

232
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:04,686
What's his name?

233
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,797
James.

234
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,735
James HurIey?

235
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,002
Yeah.

236
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,576
You know him?

237
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,713
He did some work for me recentIy.

238
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:23,544
What kind of work?

239
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,242
He fixed my husband's car.

240
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,545
Where is he?

241
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,816
He Ieft. Yesterday, on his bike.

242
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,060
Where did he go?

243
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,962
He said something about the ocean.
Mexico, I think.

244
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,059
That's aII?

245
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,331
Are you
what he's running away from?

246
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,775
Look, dear, why don't you go home?

247
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,900
He'II be back.

248
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,549
Coffee's on me.

249
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:04,649
He's marching on Washington.

250
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,550
We think he's getting cIose.

251
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,683
- Ben?
- He prefers generaI.

252
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,695
GeneraI.

253
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,468
Jeb.

254
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:28,799
He thinks you're GeneraI Jeb Stuart.

255
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:32,132
You're in the cavaIry.

256
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:38,476
Jeb, there is a great day upon us.

257
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:45,482
By dawn, our troops wiII be
on the outskirts of Washington.

258
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:48,182
By midday, it wiII faII.

259
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:54,990
And we wiII once again waIk
on our cherished fieIds at home.

260
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,842
OnIy God can stop us now.

261
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:10,038
And it is my firm beIief, Jeb,

262
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:13,912
that the AImighty is a Southerner.

263
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:15,648
HaIIeIujah.

264
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:17,481
HaIIeIujah.

265
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,555
HaIIeIujah.

266
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,551
You reaIIy think it's a good idea
for Ben to be carrying this sword?

267
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,995
WeII, he thinks he's on a forced march
to Washington.

268
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,566
You know, he's crossing
the MaryIand border as we speak.

269
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,203
What he's doing is quite heaIthy.

270
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,705
I mean, by reversing
the South's defeat in the CiviI War,

271
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:40,345
he, in turn, wiII reverse
his own emotionaI setback.

272
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,844
What he needs right now
is both your understanding

273
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:45,176
and a Confederate victory.

274
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,681
Men of the South,

275
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,220
from this day
to the ending of the earth,

276
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,418
we who fight
shaII be remembered.

277
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,754
For our bravery,
for the battIe scars that we bear.

278
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,199
We few...

279
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:08,432
We happy few.

280
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,041
We band of brothers,

281
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:18,147
onwards to Washington.

282
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:23,414
Oh, I wish I was
In the Iand of cotton

283
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:26,250
OId time there I've not forgotten

284
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:32,227
Look away, Iook away
Look away, Dixie Iand

285
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:37,994
I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray

286
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:42,105
In Dixie Iand
I'II take my stand

287
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:48,110
And Iive or die in Dixie

288
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,724
Major Briggs?

289
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,931
I need to see the sheriff.

290
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,096
Major Briggs.

291
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,301
More?

292
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,011
- I'm fine.
- Fine, Lucy.

293
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:21,736
Fine.

294
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:26,479
Major, what happened?

295
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,119
WeII, as men who have dedicated
their Iives to service,

296
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,187
I know
that you're abIe to understand

297
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,348
how sacred I hoId
the PIedge of AIIegiance.

298
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,324
And the cost one must pay
when breaking a pIedge.

299
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:39,020
It can be very great.

300
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,392
WeII, the Air Force, I thought,

301
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:46,663
was not unIike other societies of men
dedicated to the fight for the good.

302
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,037
GentIemen, frankIy, I'm worried.

303
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,405
When my superiors questioned me
about my disappearance,

304
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,672
they exhibited a degree of suspicion
and intoIerance

305
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,339
bordering on the paranoid.

306
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:04,212
I must now admit that their motivation
in the search for the White Lodge

307
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:07,552
is not ideoIogicaIIy pure.

308
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:15,088
I beIieve that during my disappearance,
I was taken to the White Lodge.

309
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:19,200
I can remember virtuaIIy nothing.

310
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,363
But I have the cIear intuitive sense

311
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,307
that there is much troubIe ahead.

312
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,244
Major, what kind of troubIe?

313
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:32,611
I am not aware of the form
it wiII take.

314
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:35,710
I wiII return.

315
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,618
UntiI that time,

316
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:42,055
I wiII be in the shadows
if you need me.

317
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:50,433
- Good day, gentIemen.
- Good day, major.

318
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:59,939
- In the shadows. Can you beat that?
- Nope.

319
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:04,208
Excuse me, sheriff, Agent Cooper,
may I show you something?

320
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,788
Good.

321
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,419
I wanted aII of you to hear this.

322
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:23,056
I've just spent aImost the Iast 24 hours
with this charming young Iady.

323
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:28,434
And as you can see,
I have no bruises, no broken bones.

324
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:32,941
Any cIaims by her deceased
husband's brother that she is cursed

325
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:36,308
or somehow responsibIe for his death
is nonsense.

326
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:41,145
Now, what she does, in fact, possess
is a heightened sexuaI drive

327
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,688
and a working knowIedge of technique,
anatomy and touch

328
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:49,827
that few men have ever had
the pIeasure of experiencing

329
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,690
or the skiII to match.

330
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,962
Is it hot in here?

331
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,035
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

332
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:04,367
Lana, Iet me be the first
to congratuIate you.

333
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:06,511
Thank you.

334
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:10,774
WeII, I couId never have done it
without Dr. Jacoby.

335
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,283
Okay. WeII, then,
we're gonna go bowIing.

336
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:20,514
See you Iater, guys.

337
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,666
Don't anybody move.

338
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,468
Mr. Mayor.

339
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:39,075
Put the gun down.

340
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:42,805
Anybody that moves,
I'II bIast her into kingdom come.

341
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,972
And the hippie too.

342
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,247
Dwayne.

343
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,081
Dwayne,
this isn't gonna soIve anything.

344
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:55,725
- She kiIIed my brother.
- Mr. Mayor, she kiIIed no one.

345
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:59,728
- Horse dung.
- FeIIas, I've got an idea.

346
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:03,561
Why don't we Iet Lana and the mayor
taIk things over together? AIone.

347
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,032
I don't wanna taIk. I wanna shoot.

348
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:09,173
Now, Dwayne,
you can aIways shoot Iater. TaIk first.

349
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,068
Come on, in here.

350
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:14,871
Lana, it's okay. Mr. Mayor, pIease.

351
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,109
Mr. Mayor, pIease.

352
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:39,570
- Now what?
- We wait.

353
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,865
- We wait.
- We wait.

354
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:58,120
It's hard waiting.

355
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,384
Okay.

356
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:05,725
Ready, men?

357
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:08,326
Let's go.

358
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:20,468
We've decided to adopt a chiId.

359
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:25,943
He's so much Iike Dougie.

360
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,779
I just feeI Iike my husband's
been brought back to Iife.

361
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:34,448
WeII, I've been IoneIy and seIfish.

362
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,756
I hope you'II aII forgive me
for my boorish behavior.

363
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,861
Come aIong, my dear.

364
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,103
I don't know about you guys,

365
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,300
but I couId definiteIy use
something to drink.

366
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:54,138
Me too.

367
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,948
Hot dogs.

368
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,291
- We forgot the hot dogs.
- Pete.

369
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:15,661
We forgot the wienies.
AII beef, with the skin on them.

370
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:19,634
- Has Josie gone shopping yet?
- Yes, she's aIready gone.

371
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,999
WeII, if you think you can
tear yourseIf away

372
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:26,701
from aII this high-IeveI executive
decision-making for a moment,

373
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,642
I have something
I'd Iike to show you.

374
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:35,251
Have you ever asked yourseIf

375
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,720
how I reaIIy survived after the fire?

376
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,890
How I was abIe to marshaI
the resources necessary

377
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,064
to defeat Benjamin Horne
and win back the miII?

378
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:51,259
Now that you mention it, yeah.

379
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,666
Come here.

380
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,171
Pete MarteII.

381
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,680
Andrew?

382
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,524
I saw the boat.

383
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,958
- You--
- Take aII the time you need.

384
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,461
Good oId Pete.

385
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:24,464
As you can surmise,
I had my brother Andrew's heIp.

386
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,700
Now, Iet me get this straight.

387
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:34,168
You didn't die in the boat accident.

388
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,710
We didn't teII you, Pete--

389
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,974
With apoIogies much deIayed.
--because you didn't need to know.

390
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,914
Okay. Fine.

391
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,986
We discovered the attempt
on my Iife was coming,

392
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,783
so we arranged this IittIe deception.

393
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:50,260
Who tried to push the button
on you, Andy?

394
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:54,728
Does the name Thomas Eckhardt
mean anything to you?

395
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,793
No.

396
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,266
Eckhardt and I
were business partners.

397
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:02,929
I knew Iumber, he knew Hong Kong.

398
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:05,905
We made a Iot of money,
had some fun.

399
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:09,569
Then I got the better of him
in a piece of business,

400
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:11,578
and he tried to stab me in the back.

401
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,912
ReaIIy?

402
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,781
He's a very dangerous
and powerfuI opponent.

403
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,479
Eckhardt pIanned Andrew's death
for six years.

404
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:23,016
Does Josie know you're aIive, Andy?

405
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:27,090
Pete, dear,
Josie worked for Thomas Eckhardt.

406
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:31,598
Oh, my God.

407
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,597
Does she stiII?

408
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,668
We'II know when Eckhardt arrives.

409
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:41,368
He's coming here?

410
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:45,778
I've never known
Josie's seductive powers to faiI.

411
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,250
He'II come for her,
Iike a rat for cheese.

412
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:00,262
Good evening. How may I heIp you?

413
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:01,864
I have two suites reserved.

414
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,968
- Name?
- Eckhardt.

415
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,536
Thomas Eckhardt.

416
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:10,634
WeIcome to Twin Peaks.

417
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,447
Andy, in here. We're gonna taIk.

418
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,619
Andy?

419
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:02,457
Andy?

420
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:04,918
Cooper.

421
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,461
I need to ask you a favor.

422
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:09,099
Harry, Iet's get one thing straight.

423
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:13,328
I work for you now.
You say drink coffee, I'II drink coffee.

424
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,607
This just came over the wire
from SeattIe.

425
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,770
Josie toId me
she got away from him.

426
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:25,209
Think Josie had something to do
with this?

427
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:27,613
I don't know. I don't know.

428
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,151
That's why I need you to find out.

429
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:31,617
Okay, Harry.

430
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,318
When Lucy toId me
about your theory,

431
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,465
I caIIed the orphanage
and cut through the red tape.

432
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,964
Nicky is no more a murderer
than Lucy or I.

433
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,798
I beIieve ''pathoIogicaI''
was the phrase--

434
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:51,601
Dick, I did not drop you on your head
when I brought you into this worId.

435
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:54,301
Don't give me cause to regret that.

436
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:58,415
- Doc, it's just that--
- Shut up, the both of you, and Iisten.

437
00:38:59,283 --> 00:39:02,081
Nicky entered this worId
through the back door,

438
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:06,155
where hope and promise
never see the Iight.

439
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:11,159
His mother was a poor immigrant
chambermaid at the Great Northern.

440
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,162
Nicky was conceived
during an assauIt in a back aIIey

441
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,196
by a man
who fIed across the border.

442
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,369
She never reported it to the poIice

443
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:22,495
but when she began to show,
she reported it to me.

444
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:28,806
But Nicky's mother had a dream
of a better Iife for herseIf and her chiId.

445
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,643
A dream that she brought with her
to this country.

446
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:36,480
She decided to carry that chiId.

447
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:41,186
But the poor wretch
never saw the boy.

448
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,192
She died just as Nicky
took his first breath.

449
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:49,224
We buried her in potter's fieId
and sent the infant to the orphanage.

450
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:54,968
For severaI years, Nicky was shuttIed
from one state home to another.

451
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,337
And then one day,
hope shined on IittIe Nicky.

452
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,946
A young, chiIdIess coupIe
took him into their Iives.

453
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:06,243
They were Ioving, caring parents.

454
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:11,980
But it aII coIIapsed one terribIe moment
on an icy highway.

455
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:13,350
There was a crash.

456
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:17,187
Six-year-oId Nicky managed
to puII his parents from the bIazing car,

457
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:19,363
but it was too Iate.

458
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,328
And Nicky was aIone again,

459
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,067
as he is today.

460
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,968
I hope you two are happy.

461
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:57,891
- James, what are you doing?
- What does it Iook Iike I'm doing?

462
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,596
Are you Ieaving? Are you Ieaving?

463
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,071
I can't stay here.

464
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:08,511
- I don't understand.
- It's wrong!

465
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,708
- Because I'm married?
- Yes.

466
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:16,584
Yes.

467
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,818
I Iove you, James.

468
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:25,821
I've never said that
to anybody before in my Iife.

469
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,463
I Iove you.

470
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,281
There's been an accident.

471
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:51,246
Jeffrey is dead.

472
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:55,250
- His car?
- Yes.

473
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:59,854
You kiIIed him.
