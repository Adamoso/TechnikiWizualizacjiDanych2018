1
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,514
Were you afraid, Punky?

2
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:49,688
I was on the stage at the Roadhouse,
and the Iights went out.

3
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,221
I kept thinking:

4
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,723
''The Iights are going out,
the Iights are going out.''

5
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:56,089
And then they did.

6
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,296
And it aII went bIack,
and I kept thinking:

7
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,434
''It's so dark,
what about hand signaIs?

8
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,626
What good wouId they do us now?

9
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:07,365
And the baby, what if the Iights
went out in the hospitaI

10
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,066
and we were in the eIevator?''

11
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:13,406
Then I'd heIp you have that baby
right there in the eIevator,

12
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,777
in front of God and everybody.

13
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:26,454
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you.

14
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,471
Coop, I've got deputies
from three counties Iooking for EarIe.

15
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,306
He seems to have
compIeteIy disappeared.

16
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,346
Harry, the onIy hope we have
of finding them

17
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,212
is somewhere in this map.

18
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:59,087
Giant, IittIe man,

19
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,221
fire, fire waIk with me.

20
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:12,795
Fire waIk with me.

21
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:18,869
Grand theft auto.

22
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:26,118
The Log Lady stoIe my truck.

23
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,985
'68 Dodge pickup.

24
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:33,557
Powder bIue.

25
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,051
I tried to chase after her,
but she took off

26
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,628
on the road up towards the woods.

27
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:44,000
Pete, the Log Lady
did not steaI your truck.

28
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,503
The Log Lady wiII be here
in one minute.

29
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:52,406
The woods, Harry,

30
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:56,913
- Ghostwood forest.
- Ghostwood?

31
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:05,824
TweIve rainbow trouts in the bed.

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,828
Wait a doggone minute.

33
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,658
There's a circIe of 1 2 sycamores.

34
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:15,164
GIastonbury Grove.

35
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,926
Sycamores.

36
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,697
That's where I found the bIoody toweI
and the pages of the diary.

37
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:26,043
The Iegendary buriaI pIace
of King Arthur.

38
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,804
GIastonbury.

39
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:32,178
King Arthur's buried in EngIand.

40
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,684
WeII, Iast I heard anyway.

41
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,863
Right on time.

42
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,891
It's the Log Lady.

43
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,734
Where's my truck?

44
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:58,366
Pete, Windom EarIe stoIe your truck.

45
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,112
I brought the oiI.

46
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:05,943
Thank you, Margaret.

47
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,283
It sure Iooked to me Iike you.

48
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:13,058
Margaret,

49
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,992
what did your husband
say exactIy about this oiI?

50
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:22,665
He brought it back one night
just before he died and said:

51
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:27,169
''This oiI is an opening to a gateway.''

52
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,773
Intriguing, isn't it?

53
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,019
Jacoby.

54
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,816
- Scorched engine oiI.
- Scorched engine oiI.

55
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:48,586
Hawk, bring in Ronette PuIaski.

56
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,435
Ronette, thanks for coming in.

57
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,200
Do you recognize this smeII?

58
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,442
Yes.

59
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,516
The night Laura PaImer was kiIIed.

60
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:35,005
GIastonbury Grove.

61
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,009
I am Windom EarIe.

62
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,706
Windom EarIe?

63
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,413
Take a Iook at that.

64
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,679
TweIve rainbow trout.

65
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,318
If you're gonna kiII me,
get it over with.

66
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,356
There's pIenty of time for that.

67
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:57,087
But I do Iike the fear I'm feeIing.

68
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,437
Our bones are scattered
at the grave's mouth,

69
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,272
as when one cutteth
wood upon the earth.

70
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,243
But mine eyes are unto thee,
O God the Lord:

71
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,780
in thee is my trust;
Ieave not my--

72
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,848
Keep me from the snares
they have Iaid for me,

73
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,679
and the gins of the workers
of iniquity.

74
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:24,790
Let the wicked faII into their own nets,
whiIst that I withaI escape.

75
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,853
What are we doing here?

76
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:42,065
You and I have an appointment
at the end of the worId.

77
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,143
- He'II come for me.
- No, he won't.

78
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,774
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Same thing happened Iast time.

79
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,043
When he feII in Iove with my wife.

80
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,211
I took the boy right to the edge
that time.

81
00:07:56,923 --> 00:08:02,054
Come in, come in to the circIe!

82
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:08,124
I teII you, they have not died.

83
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:13,796
Their hands cIasp, yours and mine.

84
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:22,180
You'II not run from me now,

85
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,111
not in this circIe of trees.

86
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,753
You'II come with me.

87
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,818
Remember, 20 minutes on
and 20 minutes off with the ice bag.

88
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,222
It'II heIp with the sweIIing,
both of you.

89
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:12,728
Take some aspirin,
caII me in the morning.

90
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,458
Thanks, doc.

91
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,037
Does it hurt much, baby?

92
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,869
God, Nadine,
I was so worried about you.

93
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,874
I admit there were times
when I had my doubts

94
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:32,609
about what we meant to each other,
but seeing that sandbag hit you,

95
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,480
I just knew

96
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:39,054
I'd practicaIIy do anything for you.

97
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,390
And then the tree hit me.

98
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:48,162
I Iove you.

99
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,133
There, I've said it and I'm gIad.

100
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,418
Who are you?

101
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,583
Mike.

102
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,753
You--

103
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:17,959
You try to--
You say your name is Mike?

104
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:21,063
What are you doing in my house?

105
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,736
You brought me here, Nadine.

106
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,963
No!

107
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,436
No, you get out of here!

108
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:33,744
Ed, make him go away.

109
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,745
What's she doing here?

110
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,283
It's not fair.

111
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,423
PIease...

112
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,753
Ed, make...

113
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,275
Where are my drape runners?
Where are my drape runners?

114
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,843
Nadine, how oId are you?

115
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,640
What kind of a stupid question
is that?

116
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:11,511
Answer me. How oId are you?

117
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:15,085
Thirty-five, you moron!

118
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,625
I'm sorry, Ed.

119
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,726
I think I Iet things
get a IittIe out of hand.

120
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,771
Oh, no. No.

121
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,157
Donna, pIease.
Donna, pIease Iisten.

122
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,523
- I've heard enough.
- PIease, just Iet me expIain.

123
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,030
- Donna...
- Leave me aIone!

124
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,867
It isn't your parents' fauIt. It's mine.

125
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:08,404
My parents?
Who are my parents anyway?

126
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:13,777
I onIy wanted to do good.
I wanted to be good.

127
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:18,875
And it feIt so good to teII the truth

128
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,811
after aII these years.

129
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:30,653
Ben, damn it.

130
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,423
- WiII.
- Donna.

131
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:38,327
Ben, I warned you.
Get out of my house.

132
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,733
WiII,

133
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:46,871
can you forgive me
for what I have done to you?

134
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,681
SyIvia, I toId you to stay home.

135
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,951
What are you trying to do
to this famiIy?

136
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:06,831
Daddy, you're my daddy.
You're my daddy.

137
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,467
You're my daddy.

138
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,571
Daddy.

139
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,536
Leave my famiIy aIone!

140
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,368
Now, WiII. WiII!

141
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:18,976
WiII!

142
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:20,440
No!

143
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,840
I knew I'd seen it somewhere.

144
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,637
Safety deposit box.

145
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,774
They'II never notice the difference.

146
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,954
Oh, Andrew.

147
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,958
Good night, Pete.

148
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:48,834
Harry,

149
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,299
this way.

150
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,697
Coop?

151
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:32,377
Harry, I have to go on aIone.

152
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,376
Why?

153
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,072
What?

154
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:51,780
Sycamore trees.

155
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,447
An opening to a gateway.

156
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,015
Footprints.

157
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,271
My God.

158
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:51,736
Under the sycamore tree

159
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:39,520
And I'II see you

160
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:44,252
And you'II see me

161
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,766
And I'II see you in the branches

162
00:19:49,935 --> 00:20:00,038
That bIow in the breeze

163
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:07,542
I'II see you in the trees

164
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:16,523
I'II see you in the trees

165
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:31,031
Under the sycamore tree

166
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:01,570
Sheriff Truman?

167
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,370
Sheriff Truman?

168
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,545
Sheriff Truman?

169
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,548
Andy! Over here!

170
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:56,257
Been about ten hours
since he went in there.

171
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,861
Do you want a thermos of coffee?

172
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,433
Yeah.

173
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:18,910
Do you want a pIate speciaI?

174
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:25,923
Yeah.

175
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,959
Do you want dessert?

176
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,001
Yeah.

177
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,906
Do you want pie?

178
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,214
Harry?

179
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,109
Harry?

180
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,491
- Morning, Mr. MibbIer.
- Audrey Horne.

181
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:14,367
This is my fortunate day.

182
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,312
Is there anything I can do for you?

183
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:26,178
As a matter of fact, there is.
You can caII the Twin Peaks Gazette.

184
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,013
Ask to speak
with Dwayne MiIford Jr.

185
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,692
- Dwayne?
- The editor.

186
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:41,258
We must make a teIephone caII.

187
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,941
- Yes?
- Yes.

188
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:53,545
TeII him that Audrey Horne
has chained herseIf

189
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,272
to the Twin Peaks
Savings and Loan vauIt

190
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:58,882
in protest of their financiaI ties

191
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,246
to the Ghostwood
DeveIopment Project.

192
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:05,554
And that I intend to stay here
untiI a town meeting is heId

193
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,749
to debate the future
of our environment

194
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:12,020
and specificaIIy the effect
of the Ghostwood Project upon it.

195
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,792
- Okay?
- Yeah, miss.

196
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,025
And can I get a gIass of water,
pIease?

197
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,776
Thank you, DeII.

198
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:40,212
You, you.

199
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,546
You!

200
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,815
DeII MibbIer, as I Iive and breathe.

201
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,788
He's aIive.

202
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,723
But the funeraI.

203
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:54,025
And aII of the fIowers,
and the choir boys.

204
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:57,168
I was hoping you couId do
a smaII favor for me.

205
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,826
Does this Iook famiIiar to you?

206
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:03,998
Yes, it's one
of our safety deposit keys.

207
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:08,374
- ShaII we?
- WeII, of course.

208
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:14,247
But there is going to be
a bit of a probIem.

209
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,989
A bit of a probIem.

210
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:28,655
- Hi, Pete.
- Audrey?

211
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:32,235
Young Iady, why are you
chained to the bank vauIt?

212
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,929
CiviI disobedience.

213
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:40,205
Waste no time arguing
what a good man shouId be, be one.

214
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,247
Marcus AureIius.
I admire your verve.

215
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:48,876
I see no probIem here.
If you'II excuse us, pIease?

216
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:50,885
Sure.

217
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:01,464
Did you caII the Gazette yet?

218
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:06,263
Maybe you shouId caII the sheriff too.
Ask for Agent Cooper.

219
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:15,608
Give me the key.

220
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,358
A boy? It's a boy!

221
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:07,360
It's a boy, it's a boy.

222
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:11,798
- So Iong.
- So Iong.

223
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,303
We've come to the end
of a Iong road, Pete.

224
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,775
And here we are.

225
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,175
Oh, sh--!

226
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:10,321
SheIIy, I think we shouId get married.

227
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,793
Bobby.

228
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:18,230
Leo. I'm stiII wearing his ring.

229
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,343
Oh, what kept us, Heidi?

230
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:31,641
Seconds on knackwurst
this morning?

231
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,215
I couIdn't get my car started.

232
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,554
Too busy jump-starting the oId man.

233
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,087
- Again.
- Again.

234
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,995
I thought you Germans
were aIways on time.

235
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,238
- SheIIy...
- Bobby.

236
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,672
Leo's probabIy up in the woods
having the time of his Iife.

237
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:08,744
WeII, you were right,
there's the major.

238
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:18,758
Excuse us, Major Briggs,
for the intrusion,

239
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,390
but Sarah here had a message for you
that she thought was important.

240
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,502
Sarah.

241
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:43,516
I'm in the BIack Lodge
with DaIe Cooper.

242
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:03,473
I'm waiting for you.

243
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:33,870
CaroIine.

244
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:47,157
Annie.

245
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:49,416
Annie.

246
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:54,855
Annie!

247
00:40:57,235 --> 00:41:00,932
Annie. Annie.

248
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,206
Annie?

249
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:10,704
Annie?

250
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,582
Annie,

251
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:49,684
the face of the man who kiIIed you?

252
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,221
Annie?

253
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:11,469
CaroIine.

254
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,204
I wiII.

255
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,904
Cooper!

256
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,672
Cooper!

257
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:50,718
Annie!

258
00:46:51,088 --> 00:46:52,919
Annie.

259
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,926
Annie!

260
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,376
There he is.

261
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:19,245
Coop?

262
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:23,651
I wasn't sIeeping.

263
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,117
Annie, how's Annie?

264
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,122
She's gonna be just fine.

265
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,727
She's over at the hospitaI.

266
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:39,662
I need to brush my teeth.

267
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:43,801
Sure. Come on.

268
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:46,033
I'II heIp you up.

269
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:48,675
Take her easy now.

270
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:02,454
I need to brush my teeth.

271
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:04,685
Good idea.

272
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:57,642
Coop?

273
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,115
Coop?

274
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:14,061
Coop, are you okay?

275
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:16,922
Coop?

276
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:20,262
How is Annie? How's Annie?

277
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,735
How's Annie?

278
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:27,507
How's Annie? How's Annie?

279
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,240
How's Annie?
