1
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:50,352
Daddy.

2
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,659
Daddy.

3
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,958
Leland.

4
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:04,596
Daddy.

5
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:07,269
Leland.

6
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:13,204
Daddy. Daddy. Leland.

7
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:15,074
Leland.

8
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,277
Leland.

9
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:22,482
Leland.

10
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,082
Leland.

11
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,089
Yeah.

12
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,694
You have the right to an attorney.

13
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,592
l waive that right.

14
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,069
l'm gonna ask you some questions.

15
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:42,105
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

16
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,742
Do you understand?

17
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,241
Yes, of course, l do.

18
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:53,149
On Friday morning, March 3rd,

19
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:56,914
did you go
to Calhoun Memorial Hospital?

20
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,817
Yes.

21
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,086
Why did you go there?

22
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,588
l was looking for someone.

23
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,358
Who were you looking for?

24
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,169
The man who killed my daughter.

25
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,433
Did you know his name?

26
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,041
No.

27
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:22,180
Yes. l do now.

28
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,781
Jacques Renault.

29
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:31,617
What made you think
he killed Laura?

30
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:34,290
You arrested him.

31
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,531
Leland...

32
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:48,634
...did you kill Jacques Renault?

33
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,572
He killed my Laura.

34
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,182
Have you ever experienced

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,412
absolute loss?

36
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,089
l doubt that any one of us
is a stranger to grief.

37
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,591
No, more than grief.

38
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,232
lt's deep down.

39
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,095
lnside.

40
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,533
Every cell screams.

41
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,874
You can hear...

42
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,543
...nothing else.

43
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,176
Yes.

44
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,184
l ki--

45
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,220
l killed him.

46
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,087
Yes.

47
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:45,122
Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes.

49
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,073
- He'll plead temporary insanity.
- We'll need a psychiatric exam.

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,874
l'll tell you one thing,
parents should not bury their children.

51
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,051
Anyone who's been through
what Leland has is--

52
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,584
Do you approve of murder,
Dr. Hayward?

53
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,221
No.

54
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,356
Hey, doc.

55
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,659
- How are you, Andy?
- Fine.

56
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,867
Great. Fine.

57
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,469
What's the problem?

58
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,603
lt's kind of personal.

59
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:31,072
l'm your doctor, Andy.

60
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:34,872
lt's about my sperms test.

61
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,878
Yes?

62
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,380
You know, l flunked.

63
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,986
That's not the precise term for it.

64
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,452
Well, l was just wondering

65
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:47,388
if it's the kind of test
you can take over.

66
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,495
You know, like a driver's exam.

67
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:55,667
l mean, l've been wearing boxer shorts
every day just like you told me.

68
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,529
You wanna give it another shot?

69
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,932
Yes, sir. l would.

70
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,701
l'll need to take a sample with me.

71
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,172
- Right now?
- Put it in a brown bag.

72
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,280
l'll wait in the car.

73
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,057
Lucy, l've got
a garbage truck here on...

74
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,503
Oh, shut up.

75
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,067
Our judge arrives this afternoon.

76
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,270
Clinton Sternwood.

77
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,340
Travels the circuit in a Winnebago.

78
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,377
Outdoors enthusiast?

79
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,875
Last of the frontiersmen.

80
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,573
They broke the mold.

81
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:24,088
l only got bail hearing for Leland
and Leo's competency examination.

82
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:25,755
Will Leland get bail?

83
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,785
Well, Harry, that's up to
your state prosecutor.

84
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,689
That'd be Daryl Lodwick.

85
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,489
Also on his way.

86
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,132
When do we hear from Hawk?

87
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,028
He called this morning.

88
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,500
Now, the county...

89
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,598
...says nobody
by the name of Robertson

90
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:44,403
had ever lived
next to the Palmers.

91
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,408
We got a current address
on the last occupants.

92
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,515
Kalispell.

93
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,878
We'll check it by afternoon.

94
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,388
- Hey. Watch it, Andy.
- Sorry, Bob.

95
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,384
Oh, my God.

96
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,396
Andy, don't move.

97
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,799
- Where did you get those?
- Don't make me say

98
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,404
where these came from.

99
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,164
Andy?

100
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:21,146
Please, Agent Cooper,
this is extremely personal business.

101
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,476
Your boots?

102
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,541
Oh, l'm sorry.

103
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:31,122
l bought these from Phillip Gerard
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.

104
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:37,494
These are the same brand of boots
we found at Leo Johnson's.

105
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,865
The Giant said
there was a clue out there.

106
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,432
l thought it was the cocaine?

107
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:45,365
Harry, we've gotta find Phillip Gerard,
the one-armed man.

108
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:48,140
Can l go now, Agent Cooper?

109
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,332
l don't know how much time l've got.

110
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,010
lf you must.

111
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,812
Harry, what's with Lucy?

112
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,362
- Mr. Horne.
- Walk and talk.

113
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,905
This friend of mine works
with the Seattle Post-Dispatch.

114
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:26,202
Actually, my sister went to college
with her but she's a friend of mine too.

115
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,509
Anyway, she called me this morning
with a hot tip. Top secret.

116
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,719
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

117
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,150
M.T. Wentz. M.T. Wentz.

118
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,120
M.T. Wentz, the travel writer.

119
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,986
Yes, M.T. Wentz the travel writer.

120
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,823
Wentz travels incognito,
uses only cash, no credit cards.

121
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:46,363
Nobody can trace his identity.

122
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:50,696
Or hers. No one at the paper
even knows who he or she is.

123
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,338
Favorable Wentz review
could be quite useful.

124
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,497
Well, he's coming.
He's coming, he's coming.

125
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:58,405
Keep an eye on the registration.
l want an hourly update.

126
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:02,046
- Scrutinize every check.
- Especially if they pay cash.

127
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:07,653
Not even 9:30 and you have
already done a good day's work.

128
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,431
Mr. Horne.

129
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,567
You look well.

130
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,467
- What can l do for you?
- Oh, we've met.

131
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,937
l sell insurance
to the small business.

132
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,804
Like One-Eyed Jack.

133
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,747
Jean Renault.

134
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,713
What's the occasion?

135
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,250
Are my premiums
about to be raised?

136
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,446
No, no. Nothing like that.

137
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,687
Please.

138
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,826
Please.

139
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:12,216
You bastard.

140
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:16,411
- You bastard!
- Make no mistake, Mr. Horne.

141
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,283
l'm just the messenger.

142
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,220
From whom?

143
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:25,355
They request a large sum of money.

144
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,631
How much?

145
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,467
l require something else entirely.

146
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,970
They should bear the cost
of their own middleman.

147
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,768
Number one.

148
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,007
Your business up there

149
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,682
is being run
by pickpockets and fools.

150
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,114
A dollar earned is a dollar stolen.

151
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,311
Are you aware of that?

152
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,154
l have my suspicions.

153
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,552
What you need is a partner.

154
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,695
Someone who can take care
of these little problems.

155
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,627
- l have a partner.
- Okay.

156
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,132
Do you want my help or no?

157
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:09,971
Yes.

158
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,408
One more thing.

159
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:19,917
l want this man
to bring to me the ransom.

160
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:23,281
This man is an FBl agent.

161
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,687
Do you want your daughter back?

162
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,020
Of course, l want my daughter back
but l can't--

163
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,723
Cash...

164
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:33,590
...partner...

165
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,336
...FBl man.

166
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,298
This is supposed to be
an equitable exchange.

167
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:43,805
This could turn out well.

168
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,673
Expect a call tomorrow...

169
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,542
...noon.

170
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:16,932
Janet.

171
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,443
Find Agent Cooper for me.
lt's urgent.

172
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,408
You're kidding?

173
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,648
What's he look like?

174
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,947
Well, you're looking
real pretty today, Donna.

175
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,217
- Thanks.
- Special occasion?

176
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:37,123
Yeah. l'm having lunch today
with someone l met on my route.

177
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,464
Bedpans and shut-ins.
Who's to meet?

178
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,757
You wouldn't understand.

179
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:47,263
- Don't spill the soup.
- Thanks, Louie.

180
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:49,499
Hey, listen to this.

181
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:51,733
l just got a call from Louie
at the Northern.

182
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,936
M.T. Wentz is coming
to Twin Peaks.

183
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,478
Empty who?

184
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,344
Hank, he's the most powerful
restaurant critic in the state.

185
00:13:58,518 --> 00:13:59,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,852
And a good review
from him and his Seattle paper

187
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,648
could give us a lot of business.

188
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,484
So she's gonna try to
send him our way.

189
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,959
What's he look like?

190
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,894
Well, nobody knows.
l guess it's a secret.

191
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,125
But he's supposed to be
arriving today.

192
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,303
Then we still got time.

193
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,907
Time for what, Hank?

194
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,037
Time for what, Hank?

195
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,484
l'm gonna pick up some flowers

196
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,485
and maybe some candles
and some tablecloths.

197
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:39,715
And what can we add to the menu?
Some specials maybe.

198
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,859
l always wanted to try
some regional dishes.

199
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,489
Babe, we're gonna trick this place out
like Christmas on the Fourth of July.

200
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,829
Oh, and l think
you should give Big Ed a call.

201
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,335
- Why?
- Well...

202
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,235
...you're still friendly, right?

203
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,739
So maybe this Wentz guy
stops in for gas.

204
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:01,242
Ed could suggest the Double R
to any new faces he sees.

205
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,880
- l'll call him.
- Good.

206
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,745
You do that.

207
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,526
So...

208
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,532
...what shall we drink to?

209
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:28,865
To Laura.

210
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,267
To Laura.

211
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:36,210
ln our hearts and memories, locked.

212
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,985
Her diary.

213
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,528
Did l tell you l had it?

214
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,261
Laura's diary?

215
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,102
Shall l read something from it?

216
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,205
lt seems appropriate.

217
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,034
Please.

218
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,415
''But still l'm afraid to tell her
of my fantasies and my nightmares.

219
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:19,818
Sometimes she's good
at understanding.

220
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,721
Other times she just giggles
and l don't have the nerve to ask

221
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,023
why things like that
are funny to her.

222
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:31,431
So l feel badly again
and shut up about it for a long time.

223
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:32,934
l love Donna very mu--

224
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:39,034
But sometimes l worry that
she wouldn't be around me at all

225
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:42,442
if she knew what my insides
were like.

226
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:48,183
Black and dark
and soaked with dreams of...

227
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,524
...big, big men and different ways
that they might hold me

228
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:56,253
and take me into their control.''

229
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,693
l'm sorry.

230
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,265
No, don't be.

231
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,163
l-- l was just, l mean--

232
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:10,138
l mean, if that's evidence,
shouldn't we give that to the sheriff?

233
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:12,835
No.

234
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,944
l mean...

235
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:18,345
l've-- l've read this
from cover to cover, Donna,

236
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,644
and there are no solutions here.

237
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,818
Besides...

238
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,985
...she gave it to me.

239
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,124
Why?

240
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:34,360
People come to me
and tell me their stories

241
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,535
about the world outside.

242
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:42,598
l take their stories
and place them

243
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:45,299
in a larger context.

244
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,872
A sort of living novel.

245
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,604
Who tells you?

246
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,113
Oh, friends.

247
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,547
Lovers.

248
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:02,918
Well, maybe, someday, you will too.

249
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,694
You were right.

250
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,172
Her kidnappers contacted me
this morning.

251
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,866
Damn me, but you were right.

252
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,869
Why didn't you alert the sheriff?

253
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,380
They'll kill her at first sign of police
involvement. That's why l called you.

254
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,849
That's no reason to circumvent
normal channels.

255
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,014
Normal channels won't bring
my daughter back to me alive.

256
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,355
You and Audrey...

257
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,066
You have a special relationship.

258
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,598
You, of all people,

259
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,535
understand her value to me.

260
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,976
They wanna make
the exchange tomorrow.

261
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,741
Audrey...

262
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,950
...for $1 25,000.

263
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,950
Cash.

264
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,815
But l must ask you.

265
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,929
Will you take it there?

266
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,197
Josie.

267
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,343
Oh, Pete.

268
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,104
So sorry.

269
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,641
Yeah, me too.

270
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,118
You know, l...

271
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,653
...keep thinking about Andrew.

272
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,587
What he would have done
about the fire.

273
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,157
Thank goodness Catherine was here
to handle everything.

274
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,495
What is it?

275
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,498
Josie,

276
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:56,305
Catherine died in the fire.

277
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,873
God, no.

278
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,472
Oh, Pete.

279
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,442
Oh, Pete.

280
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,520
We're...

281
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,751
We're planning a service...

282
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,555
...but they haven't found the body.

283
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:20,331
Oh, Pete.

284
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,764
ln a couple of days we'll go ahead.

285
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,867
l don't know exactly
what we'll be burying.

286
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:42,811
Right this way. Come on,
dreamboat. Daddy's waiting.

287
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,353
Come on.

288
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,393
Miss Horne was a very bad girl,
refusing to take her medicine.

289
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,997
- Please.
- Weren't you, Miss Horne?

290
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,161
Audrey?

291
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,868
Audrey,

292
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,437
have you been mistreated?

293
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,574
He hit me.

294
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,607
l did not hit her.

295
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,384
lf that's what you're thinking, l didn't.

296
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,451
That was wrong.

297
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:20,319
lt will never happen again
as long as you're with me.

298
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:22,391
Do you understand?

299
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:28,255
l spoke with your father
this morning.

300
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,594
You're in no danger.

301
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,428
Everything going to be fine.

302
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,437
You do trust me.

303
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,200
Don't you, Audrey?

304
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:41,038
You see, Audrey,

305
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:43,441
in a situation like this,

306
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,847
you have to handle yourself
in a professional manner.

307
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:52,046
We're all reasonable people
and what you discover

308
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:55,625
is that something reasonable
can always be worked out

309
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:59,252
whenever reasonable people
just put their minds--

310
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,866
No.

311
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,664
Lucy?

312
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,796
Lucy, we need to talk.

313
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:45,933
Deputy Brennan,

314
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,478
l thought you preferred
the company of your magazine?

315
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,646
Andy?

316
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,185
Maybe you'd better get some air.

317
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:04,351
Lucy,

318
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,498
l think we're at the point where
it would be healthier for everyone

319
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,329
if you got whatever was
bothering you out in the open.

320
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,733
Andy and l used to go out.

321
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,069
That much l gathered.

322
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,248
For a year and a half until l started
to notice things about him.

323
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:30,245
They weren't big things,
they were little things.

324
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,385
He never exercises.

325
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:40,964
He never washes his car
and he doesn't even own a sports coat.

326
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,559
Well, did you do
something about this?

327
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:48,605
Well, after l watched this TV show,
l decided l needed some me time

328
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,833
during which
we didn't see each other.

329
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:54,877
During which period
l met Dick Tremayne.

330
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:00,880
Horne's Department Store,
Men's Fashions.

331
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:05,349
He had lots of coats and keeps himself
and his car in great shape.

332
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:13,421
Most of his behavior was asinine,

333
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,432
but at least he was different.

334
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,196
Are you still seeing this Dick?

335
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,943
No.

336
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,111
Lucy, do you wanna get
back together with Andy?

337
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,414
l don't know.

338
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,922
Well, Lucy, can you tell me exactly
what you do want?

339
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,454
l don't know.

340
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,961
Sorry, Harry, l was trying to help.

341
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,036
Well, it was a good thought.

342
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:58,676
But it's like trying to fix
those potholes over on Highway 9.

343
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,038
First heavy rain and...

344
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,246
You've been down this road before?

345
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,413
Sure have.

346
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,178
Harry.

347
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,554
l've got a dangerous situation.

348
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,455
l've examined every possible angle

349
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,496
and l believe
there's only one way to proceed.

350
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,801
l need a favor, strictly between us.

351
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:25,560
What's up?

352
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:29,868
l need one of the Bookhouse Boys.
Your best man.

353
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:33,373
lt would be better
if you didn't know why.

354
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,873
Cooper, l've steered clear
when you asked me to.

355
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,883
ls there anything l need to know
about this one?

356
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,212
Absolutely not.

357
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,379
l'll set it up.

358
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,854
Nine-thirty at the Roadhouse.

359
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:49,720
Thanks, Harry.

360
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,223
- lt must be him.
- Here we go.

361
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,490
Good evening, sir,
welcome to the Double R Diner.

362
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,324
Thanks, could l have a booth?

363
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,727
Of course, right this way.

364
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:39,870
We have two very delicious
specials this evening--

365
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:43,708
l'm sure you do but l'll have
a cheeseburger, medium,

366
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,714
a Coke and some fries.

367
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,076
Very good.

368
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:53,786
Excuse me, Toad?

369
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,688
Why don't we finish this up
in the kitchen?

370
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,426
There you go.

371
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:01,225
Get in the back
and don't touch anything.

372
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:02,932
He only wanted a cheeseburger.

373
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,160
lt must be some kind of
food-critic trick.

374
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,271
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah. l think--

375
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,410
Bathroom?

376
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:18,715
Oh, right this way, sir.

377
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:22,409
We just finished painting it
and it looks really nice.

378
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:24,714
lt's completely private.
Yeah, follow me.

379
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,390
Oh, sorry.

380
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:29,219
- Good stuff.
- Toad!

381
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,921
Toad, get out of my...

382
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,952
Thanks for coming.

383
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:01,348
- l didn't know...
- Know what?

384
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,854
l didn't know if you were mad or not.

385
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:07,361
l mean, how mad.

386
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,034
l'll survive.

387
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:14,500
Donna, there's nothing going on
between me and James.

388
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,832
What if there is? l mean,

389
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:18,806
who said James and l
couldn't see other people?

390
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:21,173
l certainly didn't.

391
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:26,148
Are you saying you're seeing
someone else?

392
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,549
Maddy, l need your help.

393
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:38,524
- How?
- Harold Smith has Laura's diary.

394
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:42,194
l thought the sheriff
had Laura's diary.

395
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:46,565
Harold said that Laura kept
a second diary that l didn't know about

396
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,262
and he's got it.

397
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,997
God.

398
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:54,068
We have to tell James about this.

399
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,782
lf Laura did have a secret diary...

400
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,384
...and Harold's got it...

401
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:05,517
...l'm gonna get it
with or without you.

402
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:10,592
Tell that to James.

403
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,523
l know l paid too much for it,

404
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,327
but l just fell in love with it.

405
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,964
l heard the salesperson say,

406
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,198
''The only reason
we're still in business

407
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:59,400
is because Josie Packard
buys retail.''

408
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,214
l like it.

409
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,748
- You do?
- l like it, yeah.

410
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:12,287
- You're so cold.
- Josie.

411
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,787
Josie, l gotta know.
Were you really in Seattle?

412
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:19,623
Yes, why are you so suspicious?

413
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,163
Look at these boxes.

414
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,595
You think l got them
at Cash and Carry?

415
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,794
Why didn't you tell me
you were going?

416
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,599
You know l had to get away,
l was afraid.

417
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,937
- l know, afraid of Ben and Catherine.
- You know that.

418
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:35,409
And now Catherine's dead.

419
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:39,010
Harry?

420
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:42,143
- You don't think l--
- l don't know what to think.

421
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,312
- l don't know.
- You think l could burn the mill?

422
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:48,288
That l would ruin
everything of mine?

423
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:51,260
There's insurance money.

424
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,462
My God.

425
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:57,999
How could you?

426
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,800
How could you think
of such terrible things?

427
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,799
How could you hurt me so?

428
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,150
l was just so worried.

429
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,328
l'm sorry.

430
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:29,663
Hold me.

431
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:31,960
Hold me.

432
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,339
- Take me.
- Josie.

433
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,804
- l want you to take me.
- Josie.

434
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,139
Josie, why?
Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,152
Tear it.

436
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,090
What?

437
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,021
Tear it.

438
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:11,734
l want you.

439
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:16,036
l need you.

440
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,379
l want you

441
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,124
more than my own life.

442
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:04,290
Hi, good-looking.

443
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:08,096
Who do you have to grease
to get some coffee around here?

444
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,565
Judge Sternwood.
Hello, Your Honor.

445
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,933
Lucy, you're a cool drink of water

446
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,336
to road-weary eyes.

447
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,804
What's your secret?

448
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:23,408
l'd rather not talk about it, sir.

449
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,914
Give us a hug?

450
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,084
Life is hard, dear.

451
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,294
Still and all, it's...

452
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:40,488
lt's harder in most places
than in Twin Peaks.

453
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,827
Clinton.

454
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,098
Sorry l'm late.

455
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,600
Oh, l only just arrived.

456
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,168
Good to see you.

457
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,875
What's her name, Harry?

458
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,276
- What?
- You got the look of a man

459
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:58,972
with filly trouble, son.

460
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:04,149
lf they don't take the saddle,
you got two options.

461
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,790
- And l won't bore you with either one.
- Harry?

462
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,661
Judge Sternwood,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

463
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,227
FBl.

464
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,297
- How are you, lad?
- Your Honor.

465
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,991
You two should have
a lot in common.

466
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,197
Sid will bring in the court calendar

467
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:22,840
as soon as the Winnebago
is tanked up.

468
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:25,837
You wanna break the seal
on that lrish you stashed for me?

469
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,043
Right this way.

470
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:33,480
Mr. Cooper, how do you find
our little corner of this world?

471
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,550
Heaven, sir.

472
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:38,689
Well, this week, heaven includes

473
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,724
arson, multiple homicides

474
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:46,124
and an attempt on the life
of a federal agent.

475
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:49,357
Heaven is a large
and interesting place, sir.

476
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,332
Lucy?

477
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,742
Dick.

478
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:00,911
Lucy, l haven't slept.

479
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,046
l can't eat.

480
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:06,544
l've been absolutely miserable.

481
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:09,778
You have?

482
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:13,654
l've been a fool, a cad,
the way l've behaved and l'm...

483
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:17,257
l'm deeply, deeply ashamed.

484
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:20,387
You are?

485
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,395
l've been over it in my mind
a million times

486
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,660
and what l've come to is this.

487
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,261
l have to--

488
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:30,532
No, l must do the right thing.

489
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,272
You must?

490
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:37,941
lt's--

491
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,448
lt's everything l could
scrape together.

492
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,176
l'm completely knackered.

493
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:51,759
What is this?

494
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:55,425
Six hundred and fifty dollars.

495
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:56,964
l've called around.

496
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,762
l've been told
it's more than adequate.

497
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,501
For what?

498
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,238
For the--

499
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:08,241
To take care of--

500
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,480
You know...

501
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,012
...the little problem.

502
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,847
Richard,

503
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,812
here's what you're going to do:

504
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,619
Take your money,

505
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:25,592
put it back in your wallet
or your pocket,

506
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:28,990
turn around and walk through
both sets of doors--

507
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:31,293
The second one sticks sometimes.

508
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:36,270
--go out into the parking lot,
get in your car, turn the key,

509
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:40,137
and never, ever speak to me again

510
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,609
as long as you live!

511
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:46,341
Say one more word and l'll scream.

512
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:48,184
Leave, please.

513
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,526
Dick!

514
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,668
Dick.

515
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,313
Leland...

516
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:26,549
...this is most difficult.

517
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,059
My deepest condolences

518
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:32,390
on your heartbreaking loss.

519
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,689
Thank you, sir.

520
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:40,360
You've appeared before me
many times.

521
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:44,565
l know you to be a fine,
decent man

522
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,107
and a capable attorney.

523
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:51,008
And to see you under
these circumstances is...

524
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:53,877
ls dreadful for us all.

525
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,586
Now, the law provides a structure

526
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:00,190
to guide us through
perilous and trying times.

527
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:07,058
But it requires our submission
to its procedures and higher purposes.

528
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:13,235
Before we assume our respective roles
in this enduring drama...

529
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,763
...just let me say that

530
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:22,035
when these frail shadows
we inhabit now

531
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:25,041
have quit the stage,

532
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,747
we'll meet

533
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:31,911
and raise a glass again together

534
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:34,552
in Valhalla.

535
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,659
Would that it were so.

536
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:47,161
l understand it's your intention
to represent yourself.

537
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:49,903
Correct.

538
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:54,170
Well, where's Lodwick,
the prosecutor?

539
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,175
- Overdue.
- Well, l suggest

540
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:58,314
we leave the question of bail
till morning.

541
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,610
The facilities are adequate, Leland?

542
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,117
Oh, yes.

543
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,485
Everyone has been most kind.

544
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,590
Then we'll say good night.

545
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:12,126
- Deputy.
- Good night.

546
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:16,994
Thank you.

547
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,603
l'll speak for us all.

548
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,680
We have hard jobs.

549
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:38,919
We're ready to roll.

550
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:43,619
Well, hi, Sid.

551
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,488
Harry.

552
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,496
Sid, say hello
to Special Agent Cooper.

553
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,430
- Agent Cooper.
- How do you do?

554
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:53,627
Well, gentlemen,

555
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,699
we've been eight hours
on the road.

556
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,810
Sid and l are gonna pile it over
to The Great Northern,

557
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:05,847
hook up the Winne
and dine in the Timber Room.

558
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:08,815
See you in court.

559
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:15,953
Wife?

560
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,395
Law clerk.

561
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:22,525
Man, oh, man.

562
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:28,565
Harry, is everything set for tonight?

563
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,701
He'll be there.

564
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:32,702
Okay.

565
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,751
ls this your friend Katrina?

566
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,616
Katrina? Katrina.

567
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:50,182
And this is Miss...

568
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,695
Come along, girls.

569
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,964
All right, Mr. Tojamura. We're all set.

570
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:40,474
Now, what credit card
do you wanna put that on?

571
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:43,670
- Cash, please.
- Cash?

572
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,678
Fine.

573
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,750
Where did you say
you traveled from, sir?

574
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:51,854
- Seattle.
- Seattle?

575
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:55,286
Oh, that's not such a long trip, then.

576
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,489
Very good, Mr. Tojamura.

577
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,096
The bellman will take you
up to your suite.

578
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:02,857
And if you would like to treat yourself

579
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:06,332
to some of our outstanding
local cuisine while you're here,

580
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:09,962
l would recommend
the Double R Diner.

581
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,306
Ask for Norma.

582
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,274
Thank you very much.

583
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,351
Norma, it's Louie.

584
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,151
l think the eagle has landed.

585
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,163
- Pete, meet my cousin Jonathan.
- Jonathan.

586
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:38,358
You thinking cousin have some joe?

587
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:42,130
After a long flight it will help him
reset his biographical clock.

588
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,698
That's ''biological.''

589
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,101
l think so, l just made a fresh pot.

590
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,803
Here. Cup of joe coming up.

591
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,813
- Biological.
- Biological.

592
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,182
Don't know how you lasted six years.

593
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,415
Nothing but hayseeds
and manual laborers.

594
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,684
Well, we all got our job to do.

595
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:05,863
Yours is nearly finished.

596
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:09,055
The sale of the mill
and the Packard lands?

597
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:11,861
Signing the contracts soon.
l need Pete's signature.

598
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:14,367
- He's Catherine's heir.
- Will that be difficult?

599
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,540
- No.
- How long?

600
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:20,074
- Two days.
- We're expected back in Hong Kong.

601
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,406
Mr. Eckhardt wants very much
to see you.

602
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:27,711
Are there any other complications?

603
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:31,211
There might be a problem with Hank.

604
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,191
l'll deal with him.

605
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,888
- Are we suspected?
- Certainly not.

606
00:43:38,095 --> 00:43:40,154
What about this sheriff?

607
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:41,729
He means nothing to me.

608
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,764
That's not what l asked you.

609
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:57,703
Nine-thirty, right on the tick.

610
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:00,307
ls he here?

611
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,314
He's here.

612
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:13,892
Are we in any particular hurry?

613
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,565
Harry,

614
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:18,633
let me buy you a beer. Bartender?

615
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:24,066
All right, l'm coming!

616
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:25,902
All right!

617
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:30,270
Hey, we're not op--

618
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:37,777
Oh, fart.

619
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:54,734
What's the deal?

620
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,644
Do l know you?

621
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:14,991
Okay.

622
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:40,549
Listen, l think l'm just gonna
lay here for a while.

623
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,016
What?

624
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,847
What?

625
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:59,325
Blood brother,
next time l take your head off.
