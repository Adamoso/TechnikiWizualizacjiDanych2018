1
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,675
- Get her arms.
- I got this side.

2
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:41,513
Miss PuIaski?

3
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,081
- Cover her arms.
- Miss PuIaski, caIm down now.

4
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,549
It's okay. It's gonna be aII right.

5
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,746
- Get her Iegs.
- I got it. Hang on.

6
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,184
Miss PuIaski,
just caIm down, pIease.

7
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,225
- You're aII right.
- Give her a sedative.

8
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,761
No! No!

9
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:20,314
Ronette puIIed out her IV.
I just gave her a sedative.

10
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,954
Looks Iike dye.

11
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,821
- Harry, give me a hand.
- What's this?

12
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,724
A IittIe chIoride.
Spray her finger.

13
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,990
AIbert, get your microscope.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,724
AII right.

15
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:38,295
AII right, Ronette.
Breathe, now, honey.

16
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,445
- He's been here.
- We have a 24-hour guard.

17
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,242
Harry, he did this.

18
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,782
And he tainted the IV.

19
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:53,943
Maybe she saw him.

20
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,489
Maybe she heard a Sousa march
and got up to Iook for her baton.

21
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,126
I'II do a workup on the IV.

22
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:02,994
That's our man.

23
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,791
Those Ietters were never made pubIic.

24
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,526
FeIIas,

25
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,000
Iet's stand together for a moment.

26
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,770
It's time I mentioned something.

27
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,211
Now, I'm not sure,

28
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:21,438
but I beIieve I was visited by a giant.

29
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,045
Twice.

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,547
In my room.

31
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,480
He Ieft me three cIues.

32
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:29,721
The first had to do with
Jacques RenauIt in a body bag.

33
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,688
It came true aImost immediateIy.

34
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,057
The second was,
''The owIs are not what they seem.''

35
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:41,996
The third was about a man
who points without chemicaIs.

36
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,829
You were visited by a giant?

37
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,407
Any reIation to the dwarf?

38
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,982
You're wearing a different sweater
than yesterday.

39
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,087
CoIor's better on you.

40
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,084
I forgot my manners.

41
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,588
I'm HaroId Smith.

42
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:08,588
I guess you know who I am.

43
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,290
PIease come in.

44
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,733
WouId you Iike some Iemonade?

45
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,275
I aIso have some saItines
and some appIe butter.

46
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,935
Or wouId you
Iike to wash your hands?

47
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,444
No, thanks.

48
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,105
I insist.

49
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,257
It's very warm in here.

50
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,297
- Don't be nervous, Donna.
- I'm not nervous.

51
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,956
I'm curious.

52
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:52,195
Curious about my reIationship
with Laura.

53
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,136
Why did you send me that Ietter?

54
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:58,869
Laura wanted me to get in touch with
you if anything ever happened to her.

55
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,376
Why?

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,644
She said you'd ask
a Iot of questions.

57
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,212
How Iong did you know Laura?

58
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:10,219
Ever since she began
MeaIs on WheeIs.

59
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,587
I was her best customer.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,491
You don't seem
much Iike a shut-in.

61
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:21,464
You mean, poIiteIy,
what's the matter with me?

62
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:22,659
Okay.

63
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,060
I don't Iike to go outside.

64
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,433
I...

65
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:33,969
...can't.

66
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,308
Do you have a judgment
you'd Iike to express?

67
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:38,815
No.

68
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,952
Laura said you were very fair-minded.

69
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,149
If you knew her so weII, why didn't she
ever mention you to me?

70
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:49,954
WeII, Laura Iiked to think of me...

71
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,795
...as a mystery in her Iife.

72
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:55,757
Then why did you caII me?

73
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,929
I am--

74
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:04,543
WeII, I used to be a horticuIturist.

75
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,201
I raise orchids.

76
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,540
That's why it's so warm in here.

77
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,842
They don't need a Iot of Iight.

78
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,215
I wrote to you because I wondered

79
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,218
if you'd be kind enough
to pIace one of them on her grave.

80
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,319
Of course.

81
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,921
- WiII you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.

82
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,493
This is a hybrid.

83
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:04,359
- A Iady's sIipper.
- It's very beautifuI.

84
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:13,712
Take it, pIease.
My Iast gift to Laura.

85
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:17,214
That's very kind of you, Mr. Smith.

86
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,747
HaroId.

87
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:25,115
She was very kind to me.

88
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,193
Forgive me, but I know so much
about you, you see.

89
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,690
What?

90
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,359
You're every bit as IoveIy
as Laura said you were.

91
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:48,641
I'II be back.

92
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,614
I'II be here.

93
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,322
R, B, T.

94
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:08,126
Harry, I beIieve that these Ietters
and the Giant's cIues

95
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,667
are in some way reIated
to this Iong-haired man.

96
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,296
Mrs. PaImer saw him in a vision.

97
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,169
She caIIed this morning
to say that Maddy

98
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,333
had seen the man twice
in the past two days,

99
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,842
both times in a vision.

100
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,571
I've seen him in my dream.

101
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:23,807
And Ronette.

102
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,747
- Saw him physicaIIy at the train car.
- Right.

103
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,912
Four of us have seen him
in different forms.

104
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,617
This path is a psychic Iink
that wiII Iead us straight to him.

105
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:39,587
So, what did this giant sound Iike?

106
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,758
I mean, did he have
a big, booming voice or what?

107
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:46,997
- No, no. He spoke softIy, distinctIy.
- And you gave him the beans

108
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,198
you were supposed to use
to buy a cow?

109
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:51,769
No, AIbert, I gave him my ring.

110
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,211
Okay,

111
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,544
confining my concIusions
to the pIanet Earth,

112
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,777
the cocaine you found
in James HurIey's gas tank

113
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,683
was a match to what we found
in Jacques' car

114
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,221
and Leo's house.
Get the picture?

115
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,448
Even got the frame.

116
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,785
Handiwork of Leo Johnson,

117
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,691
currentIy appearing at CaIhoun
MemoriaI HospitaI as Mr. Potato Head.

118
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,992
The boots are a CircIe Brand
rare work boot.

119
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,192
Ones we found haven't been worn
or tampered with.

120
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,634
The Ietter B from Ronette's finger

121
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,707
was cut from a copy of Flesh World.
It's a perfect match.

122
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,174
This particuIar edition features
swingers' cIubs

123
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:28,246
for standard poodIe enthusiasts.

124
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,845
No comment.

125
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,543
We sent a portrait
of your Iong-haired man

126
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,654
to every agency from NASA
to DEA and came up empty.

127
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,551
This cat is in nobody's database.

128
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:40,818
A man that four of us
have seen here in Twin Peaks.

129
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,388
Sure.

130
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,361
Oh, by the way, you were shot
with a WaIther PPK.

131
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,335
It's James Bond's gun,
did you know that?

132
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,538
You're Iooking better today, Coop.

133
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,730
Thank you, AIbert. FeeIing better.

134
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:56,933
The traiI of the man who shot you
is ice-coId,

135
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,408
but I hoovered some fibers
from the corridor outside your room.

136
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,945
My ticket out of TroIIeyviIIe.

137
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:03,672
I'II be at the Iab, gentIemen.

138
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,875
- Anything we shouId be working on?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,045
You might practice waIking without
dragging your knuckIes on the fIoor.

140
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,283
AIbert, Iet's taIk about knuckIes.

141
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,518
Now, the Iast time,
I knocked you down.

142
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,755
I feIt bad about it. The next time's
gonna be a reaI pIeasure.

143
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,399
You Iisten to me.

144
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,261
WhiIe I wiII admit to
a certain cynicism,

145
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,528
the fact is that I'm a naysayer
and hatchet man

146
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,262
in the fight against vioIence.

147
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,134
I pride myseIf in taking a punch

148
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,605
and I'II gIadIy take another

149
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:33,610
because I choose to Iive my Iife
in the company of Gandhi and King.

150
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,146
My concerns are gIobaI.

151
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:41,549
I reject absoIuteIy revenge, aggression
and retaIiation.

152
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,417
The foundation of such a method...

153
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,950
...is Iove.

154
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,592
I Iove you, Sheriff Truman.

155
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,600
AIbert's path is
a strange and difficuIt one.

156
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,976
Deputy.

157
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,653
James, you're not
gonna be charged.

158
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,450
The cocaine we found in your bike
was pIanted.

159
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,024
- I was trying to teII you that when--
- James,

160
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,024
I don't wanna see you
down here again.

161
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:24,422
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,157
Stop trying to
figure it aII out yourseIf.

163
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,801
Find someone to taIk to.
TaIk to me.

164
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,597
Go on home, James.

165
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,306
How's it going, Lucy?

166
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,844
Seventy-five words.

167
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:42,973
Oh, wait a minute, 76.

168
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,116
- Seventy-seven.
- Good work, Lucy.

169
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:51,118
That's 78.

170
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,226
Agent Cooper asked me to find
as many words as I couId

171
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:59,161
that contain the Ietters B, T and R.

172
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:03,029
Let me see.
I used to be pretty good at this.

173
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:17,172
My Iunch date is here.

174
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:21,351
This is the date that made Andy
caII in sick?

175
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,555
Hi, Lucy.

176
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,021
There you are.

177
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,855
HeIIo, Dick.

178
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:35,225
Lucy, I've aIways considered you
to be a woman of Ietters.

179
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:38,028
''Prohibited.''

180
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:44,909
I say, I don't beIieve
we've met.

181
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:46,204
Richard Tremayne.

182
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,006
Horne's Department Store.

183
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,240
Designer Menswear.

184
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,541
Robot.

185
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,749
Did I do something to anger him?

186
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:01,223
Not that native peopIe don't have
enough reason to be angry, per se.

187
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:04,689
- Let's go to Iunch.
- CapitaI.

188
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,331
We'II go Dutch.

189
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:11,700
So how taII was this guy?
Did his head hit the ceiIing?

190
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,736
AImost.

191
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:19,335
I beIieve that the ceiIings in The
Great Northern are at Ieast 1 0 feet taII.

192
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:20,773
At Ieast.

193
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:21,971
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,112
I hope I'm not interrupting.

195
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,917
That's okay, LeIand.
What's on your mind?

196
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,147
This man.

197
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,792
I know him.

198
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,488
How do you know him,
LeIand?

199
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,923
When I was a IittIe boy,

200
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,796
my grandfather had a summer home
up on PearI Lakes.

201
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,767
We used to go there every year.

202
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,463
- You knew him from there?
- Yes. Yes.

203
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:51,235
Now, I know that
he wasn't a CheIbert.

204
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,435
They were our neighbors that Iived
on one side.

205
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,275
On the other side
there was a vacant Iot.

206
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:58,917
Next to that was a white house.

207
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,916
That's where he Iived.

208
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,612
Do you remember a name?

209
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,279
No.

210
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,627
I think...

211
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,627
I think it was
Robertson. Robertson.

212
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:12,821
Robertson.

213
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:17,095
Robert. R, T, B. That's what
the Ietters are trying to speII.

214
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,467
Hawk, get up to PearI Lakes, find out
who used to Iive in that white house.

215
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,699
I'II do what I can.

216
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,370
LeIand, thank you.

217
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:28,105
- That's vaIuabIe information. Thanks.
- Thank you, LeIand.

218
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,805
Something eIse.

219
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,150
He used to fIick matches at me.

220
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,985
He'd say:

221
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,027
''You wanna pIay with fire,
IittIe boy?''

222
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,233
That's our man.

223
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:11,589
Of course, most of the time I keep
my department running Iike a top,

224
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,725
but Christmas--
WeII, that was such a madhouse.

225
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,588
Was absoIuteIy
no time for paperwork.

226
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,730
I simpIy had to deveIop a system
to memorize customer orders

227
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,866
using mnemonic triggers.

228
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:24,594
For instance,
someone Iooking for argyIe socks?

229
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,434
WeII, that wouId fiIe under A
for ''argyIe,'' subheading S for ''socks.''

230
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:30,940
Now, it does get tricky.

231
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,773
A request for a vuIcanized mackintosh,
for instance--

232
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,916
Now, does that fiIe under R
for ''raingear,''

233
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:39,847
or W for ''waterproof''?

234
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,547
My famiIiarity with the inventory
finds me Ieaning towards an R.

235
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,191
Lucy, may I ask you something?

236
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:52,356
Do you find it odd that
I don't switch my fork when I eat,

237
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:55,398
that I Iift it to my mouth
with my Ieft hand?

238
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,932
My mother caIIs it piIing.

239
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,533
ActuaIIy, it's not odd at aII.

240
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,074
It's the European way.

241
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:10,576
It's been six weeks, Dick.
You said you were gonna caII.

242
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,648
I know.

243
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,811
I Iost your phone number.

244
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:19,884
I work for the sheriff.
You couId've diaIed 91 1 .

245
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,287
Lucy, I do apoIogize.
I've been so terribIy busy, honestIy.

246
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,897
I've hardIy had time to feed my cat.

247
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,596
We went out every Thursday night
for three months.

248
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:34,968
You made promises to me. You said
you were gonna take me to dinner

249
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,167
at the Space NeedIe in SeattIe.

250
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:42,508
Even though you took me to
FamiIy Night at the Pancake PIantation,

251
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:46,140
I stiII couIdn't heIp but think
that it meant something speciaI.

252
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,418
When in fact the onIy thing speciaI
we did that night

253
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,181
was drink two bottIes of champagne

254
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:55,350
and end up on a dispIay bed
in Horne's Home Furnishings!

255
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:06,267
I admit it was daring.
That made it exciting.

256
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,636
StiII, I thought it wouId Iead to more.
Like a phone caII.

257
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,006
Lucy, I feeI terribIe you're upset.
ReaIIy I do.

258
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,442
- Let me make it up to you.
- Like how, for instance?

259
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,509
For starters,

260
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,812
I know I promised you a new dress
at my 20 percent empIoyee discount.

261
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,050
After Iunch, I'II go right back

262
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,319
and arrange something with Ms. BoIbo
in women's wear. Very speciaI indeed.

263
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,291
Oh, yeah?

264
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,796
How about a maternity dress!

265
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,627
Pardon?

266
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,804
I'm pregnant, Richard.

267
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,970
Pregnant.

268
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,370
Preggers?

269
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:51,142
Does Donna seem different to you?

270
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,807
What do you mean?

271
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,818
WeII, Iike, doesn't her smoking
and stuff bother you?

272
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:59,651
She's trying to act, Iike, aII tough
aII of a sudden.

273
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,693
James, you know her
better than I do.

274
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:04,921
Yeah.

275
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:08,066
She came to visit
when I was in jaiI and...

276
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,366
I don't know.

277
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:12,695
What?

278
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,566
WeII,

279
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,903
she acted Iike she wanted

280
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,773
to do it with me
through the bars.

281
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,915
She didn't even care
if anybody was around.

282
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,413
I don't know.

283
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,109
It was weird.

284
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,755
It wasn't Iike her.

285
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,083
I don't know.

286
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,658
I don't know anything anymore.

287
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:39,931
Sometimes I think I shouId
just get on my bike and go.

288
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,035
James.

289
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:48,663
Running away
won't soIve anything.

290
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,315
It's gonna be okay.

291
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,485
Donna, where you been?
You're Iate.

292
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,899
I met someone
from MeaIs on WheeIs.

293
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,995
Those oId foIks must have
some pretty cooI stories.

294
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,568
This was a young man.

295
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,762
ReaIIy?
What's wrong with him?

296
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,265
You know, it's hard to say.

297
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:28,937
Other than he was bright
and charming, inteIIigent.

298
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,841
CompIeteIy unIike anybody I know.

299
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,783
What's that supposed to mean?

300
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:38,322
Why don't you sit here and hoId hands
and try to figure it out.

301
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,336
That's good, Emory.

302
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:02,545
She's ready for her cIose-up now.

303
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,557
We shouId get rid of her.

304
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:21,699
She knows I sent Laura up here,
she knows her father owns the pIace.

305
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:26,304
With what Ben Horne wiII pay to get
his funked-up IittIe daughter back,

306
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,064
I'II buy the bastard out.

307
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:31,675
Look, I don't wanna Iose my job.

308
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:37,379
Honey, if this doesn't work,
you'II Iose a Iot more than your job.

309
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,519
We can't handIe this aIone.
Ben Horne is dangerous.

310
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:46,488
Now, Iisten, you spineIess gasbag,
you are in this up to your shiny pate.

311
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,923
Now, stop whining.

312
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:53,997
You do as I teII you, and we'II have
aII the heIp we need.

313
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:00,428
Look at her.

314
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,700
Riding the white tiger.

315
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:08,544
In a few days
she won't wanna come down.

316
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:12,907
Just Iike her daddy did to me.

317
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,749
Now, these babies
are just perfect.

318
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,916
For heavy fieId work,
and they're extremeIy versatiIe.

319
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:26,224
- DurabIe, with a steeI reinforced toe.
- Not quite right.

320
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,959
Now, if the department does
any parading,

321
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:34,970
on the Fourth or Veterans Day,
these are your best bet.

322
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,300
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

323
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:40,571
Add some siIver-trimmed Iaces,
it's a reaI eye-catcher.

324
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,715
I can see that. But a IittIe outside
my budget, Mr. Gerard.

325
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,247
I understand compIeteIy.

326
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,385
- You need something more practicaI.
- Yep.

327
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,578
A shoe for aII seasons.

328
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:54,657
Now, this is more Iike it.

329
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:58,388
Yeah. Jim-dandy.

330
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,358
Very popuIar.

331
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:06,732
The IoveIy thing about--

332
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,839
Mr. Gerard?

333
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,498
Mr. Gerard, you okay?

334
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,609
I'm sorry.

335
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,805
Sometimes I get
a bit disoriented.

336
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,815
Can I get you something?
Water?

337
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:24,513
If there's a bathroom,
I have a medication.

338
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,820
Sure. It's right down the haII.
This way.

339
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,476
Thanks for coming down, SheIIy.

340
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,169
Sheriff, I'm just gonna say this:

341
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:51,373
I know I don't have to, so I'm not
gonna say anything against Leo.

342
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,381
We're not asking you to.

343
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:56,544
He's my husband. I don't have
to testify against my husband.

344
00:22:56,922 --> 00:23:01,359
WeII, you're not testifying.
You're just giving us a statement.

345
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,622
Doc Hayward says he's too sick.

346
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,326
What difference does it make?

347
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,202
The difference, SheIIy,
is there's some peopIe injured

348
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,235
and there's some peopIe dead.

349
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,465
Now, we know Leo started that fire.

350
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,070
And we know you were there.

351
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:24,547
I'm not gonna say anything
against him.

352
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,650
I Iove him.

353
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:32,646
Okay, SheIIy, that's fine.

354
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:35,089
- Thanks for coming in.
- What?

355
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,696
Oh, I think SheIIy's thought
Iong and hard about this.

356
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:42,664
Maybe someday, with a IittIe Iuck
and some topfIight medicaI attention,

357
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,200
you'II have Leo back.

358
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:49,098
The same oId Leo
that you obviousIy stiII Iove.

359
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:57,538
Maybe then he'II reaIize what
a wonderfuI person he's married to.

360
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:59,047
What?

361
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:01,049
Thanks again, SheIIy.

362
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,915
Best of Iuck.

363
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:06,724
What's going on?

364
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,757
SmeIIs Iike insurance money.

365
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,758
SheIIy didn't dream this up herseIf.

366
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,954
So who do you think is
puIIing the strings?

367
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:14,394
Harry,

368
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,295
that's a damn good question.

369
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,032
Bob...

370
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,770
...I know you're near.

371
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,408
I'm after you now.

372
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:30,207
- Mr. Horne?
- Tsk tsk. Gotta go, Jerry.

373
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:34,371
Mr. Horne, have you heard
anything from your daughter?

374
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,310
Not since I spoke to
Sheriff Truman yesterday.

375
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,279
She phoned me Iast night.

376
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,214
- From where?
- She didn't say.

377
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,217
She referenced seeing me
in my tuxedo.

378
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:47,051
Now, I was wearing a tux here
at the hoteI the night that I was shot.

379
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:51,287
WeII, Iike I toId you,
Audrey's gone missing before

380
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,658
on a semi-reguIar basis.

381
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:56,130
So have two other
IocaI girIs recentIy.

382
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,701
Mr. Horne, speaking frankIy,
is there troubIe at home?

383
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,973
Mr. Cooper,

384
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:07,908
do I detect a note of something outside
the scope of professionaI concern?

385
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:11,008
Audrey and I have struck up
an acquaintance.

386
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,250
Acquaintance.

387
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,752
Agent Cooper.

388
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:21,053
Let me give you the best advice
that you're gonna get aII week:

389
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:23,660
Men faII under the speII
of Audrey's charms

390
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,820
Iike ducks in a shooting gaIIery.

391
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:30,833
And if you don't want a
Ioad of buckshot in your taiI feathers,

392
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:35,667
may I suggest that you park your jaIopy
outside of somebody eIse's window.

393
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:40,901
Mr. Horne, if I've overstepped my
bounds with my concern, I apoIogize.

394
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,377
I am here
with onIy the best intentions.

395
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,413
That is achingIy cIear.

396
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,678
And not unappreciated.

397
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,779
I'II put a Iamp in the window,

398
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:54,892
you'II be my first caII
when she comes home to roost.

399
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,288
Thank you.

400
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:00,029
No, thank you.

401
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,260
WeIcome back.

402
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:34,560
Where am I?

403
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:38,093
I brought you something.

404
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,932
Open wide.

405
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,464
EngIish carameIs.

406
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:46,338
Sugar's what you need.

407
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:53,609
- PIease...
- Go sIow, baby.

408
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,815
Candy's dandy, huh?

409
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,786
PIenty more where that came from.

410
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,829
My name is Jean.

411
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,945
Sweet sIeep.

412
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,246
FeeI the warmth.

413
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,157
That's the man.

414
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,385
Oh, my God.

415
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:38,153
- You know him?
- FBI.

416
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,197
He's FBI. I saw him at the town
meeting after Laura died.

417
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,697
He was up here?

418
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:44,165
I want him.

419
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,896
Jean RenauIt. Emory,

420
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:50,665
say something weak and fawning.

421
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:52,469
Jacques was your brother?

422
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:55,345
And this is my sister.

423
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,008
Nancy?

424
00:28:57,182 --> 00:29:00,811
I aIso had a brother, Bernard.

425
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,147
This business cost me them both.

426
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,052
I toId you we'd have heIp.

427
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,426
I'm your go-between.

428
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:15,692
The father pays me,
my cut is 30 percent.

429
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,563
The father never know
who snatch his baby.

430
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:21,535
And I get the man
who kiII my brother.

431
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,173
What's his name?

432
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:26,372
- Cooper.
- Cooper.

433
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:29,241
And aII you have to do
is bring him to me.

434
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:33,450
Mr. Horne can maybe do that.

435
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:37,816
But you're going to be a big heIp,
aren't you?

436
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:41,390
Whatever you want--
Want me to do.

437
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,188
The tape of the girI.
Get it now.

438
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,421
Yes, aII right.

439
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:51,894
She goes back north,

440
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,406
- or this deaI goes south.
- Jean, teII my sister to behave herseIf,

441
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,908
or you'II get mad.

442
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,440
She stays.

443
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:05,105
You get the money, I get Cooper.
Everybody happy.

444
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,254
Of course, we...

445
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:12,890
We can't Iet the girI Iive now,

446
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:14,650
can we?

447
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,621
No, no, no. Thanks, Pete.
I appreciate the caII.

448
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,131
Harry?

449
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:25,132
Time for a break.

450
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,437
Josie caIIed Pete.
She'II be back tomorrow afternoon.

451
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,507
Great. Let's bring her in.

452
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,609
Coop, I need a favor.

453
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:40,183
I'd Iike to see her first.
AIone.

454
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:44,415
Harry, we can't Iet personaI feeIings
interfere with our work.

455
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,113
Easier said than done.

456
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,253
TaIk to her.
Bring her in.

457
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:53,158
You know there's a chance that
she's not invoIved with any of this.

458
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:56,494
Harry, you have my bIessing.

459
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,295
PearI Lakes.

460
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,870
There's a vacant Iot
next to the PaImer house.

461
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,371
Next to that there's a white house
aII boarded up.

462
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:06,978
- MaiIbox, no name on it.
- TitIe check?

463
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:10,308
County's working on it. Power and
Lights are searching their records.

464
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:13,007
- How soon before we know?
- Morning, earIiest.

465
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:15,278
Hawk, you haven't seen Mr. Gerard,
have you?

466
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:17,648
- Shoe saIesman?
- The one-armed man?

467
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:19,221
He came in to show me
some sampIes.

468
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,316
The one-armed man was here?

469
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:24,155
Yeah, he got faint
and had to go to the bathroom.

470
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,024
Never came back.

471
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:29,929
Harry, remember in my dream?
The one-armed man knew Bob.

472
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:44,713
What's going on?

473
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,425
''Without chemicaIs, he points.''

474
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:01,430
The Giant's third cIue.

475
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,559
Harry, we've got to find
the one-armed man.

476
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:20,609
Is that reaIIy necessary, doc?

477
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,514
It's for her own protection, Ed.

478
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:25,053
She ripped two pair
of Ieather restraints Iast night

479
00:32:25,223 --> 00:32:28,522
Iike tissue paper.
I ran a bIood test.

480
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,719
She's pumping out more adrenaIine
than a wiIdcat weII.

481
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:33,796
Never seen anything Iike it.

482
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:37,067
Now, your being here
may quiet her.

483
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:41,103
TaIk to her. Maybe sing.
She got a favorite song?

484
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:43,207
Favorite song?

485
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,275
Beats a trip to Lourdes.

486
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,275
Okay.

487
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,716
But if I'm gonna sing to her, doc,
I'd rather it was just the two of us.

488
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:56,877
I'II cIose the door behind me.

489
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,263
Nadine?

490
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,763
Doc says I shouId sing a song for you.

491
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:13,460
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm not sure what you'd Iike to hear.

492
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:25,571
On top of Old Smokey

493
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:29,852
All covered with snow

494
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:34,690
l lost my true lover

495
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:38,619
A-courtin' too slow

496
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:43,589
Courting's a pleasure

497
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:47,864
Parting's a grief

498
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,371
A false-hearted lover

499
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:56,572
ls worse than a thief

500
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,881
Good God.

501
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,518
You're a jack and l'm a jack
And Steeplejacks are we

502
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,527
And when we climb up to the top

503
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:16,064
The cry is victory!

504
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:19,795
V-l-C-T-O-R-Y!

505
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:21,996
Vi--

506
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,505
Hi, Eddie.

507
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:26,701
Did you come by
to pick me up?

508
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:33,548
Doc Hayward says
tonsiIIitis or no tonsiIIitis,

509
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:36,619
I can go to cheerIeading tryouts.

510
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:38,847
CheerIeader tryouts?

511
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:42,152
WeII, I'm a senior, Eddie.

512
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,887
You know what they say.

513
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:49,891
You're onIy 1 8 once.

514
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,970
Dr. Jacoby?

515
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:30,607
Gents.
Come on in.

516
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:34,204
This is my wife, EoIani.

517
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:38,246
She Iives at our pIace in HanaIei.

518
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:43,979
We're-- WeII, we're practicing
a kind of creative kahuna heaIing.

519
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,214
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.

520
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:49,755
Are you ready to be hypnotized?

521
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:54,726
Yes, yes.
I've been under many times.

522
00:35:55,767 --> 00:36:00,101
This is the autosuggestion program
that I use.

523
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,933
EoIani, start the tape, pIease.

524
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,470
Sheriff Truman.

525
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:11,439
WouId you hoId this stone, pIease,
at the end of the bed there?

526
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:15,746
Great. Just--

527
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,755
Yes.

528
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,527
Okay, Agent Cooper.
I'm ready.

529
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:30,428
''You are standing on
a smooth, green carpet of grass.

530
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,799
The baII is 1 5 feet from the hoIe.

531
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:40,638
Beyond the green,
two pristine white sand traps

532
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:44,873
and a IiIy-fiIIed pond yawn out
towards the emeraId fairway.

533
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:48,780
The hoIe seems to sIowIy drift away
across the green

534
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:52,184
towards the pond,
carried by the summer wind.

535
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,724
The green grows Iarger and Iarger.

536
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:57,828
The green enguIfs you,

537
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:02,296
enveIoping you
in a soft bIanket of peace.

538
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:03,900
Harry.

539
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:08,297
You stroke the baII.

540
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:14,509
It drifts towards the hoIe
and gentIy drops in its center.''

541
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,977
Can you hear me, Dr. Jacoby?

542
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,076
Yes.

543
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:23,881
You're in your hospitaI room.
In the room is Jacques RenauIt.

544
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:28,321
Do you smeII anything?
Burned engine oiI?

545
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:32,020
I smeII engine oiI at the park.

546
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,222
Air is fiIIed with it.

547
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:38,002
AII right, we're going back to your room
at the hospitaI now.

548
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:40,069
Does anyone come into the room?

549
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:41,762
Nurses,

550
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,407
Doc Hayward.

551
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,873
You, Sheriff Truman.

552
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:47,602
What happens after we Ieave?

553
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:51,174
I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay.

554
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,909
I'm juggIing coconuts at a Iuau.

555
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:57,380
The guests are aII Nigerians.

556
00:37:57,555 --> 00:37:59,682
AII right.

557
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,621
Does anyone eIse come into the room,
Iater that night?

558
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:07,056
The sound of the tape ripping
wakes me up.

559
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,098
I see a piIIow going over his face.

560
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:13,431
He's making this sound.

561
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,901
Almost like a dog barking.

562
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,609
Jacques stops moving.

563
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,045
I Iook up to see
who's hoIding the piIIow.

564
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,650
Who is it?

565
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,149
Do you see who it is?

566
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:31,049
I know him.

567
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:53,239
Hi.

568
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:59,109
This is from HaroId Smith.

569
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:03,412
Sorry I haven't been out
to see you since the funeraI,

570
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,182
but things have been
pretty strange.

571
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,818
So were you sIeeping with
this guy HaroId or what?

572
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,190
He seems pretty nice.

573
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,593
Kind of an oddbaII.

574
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,803
AIthough, I guess anyone
can start to seem Iike that

575
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,203
when you Iook cIose enough.

576
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:30,105
We need to taIk.

577
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,349
Maybe you aIready know
about me and James.

578
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:39,047
But anyway, after you died,
we kind of got together.

579
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:42,989
This isn't something
I feeI Iike I have to expIain to you

580
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:47,720
because you probabIy knew
how we feIt before we did.

581
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:52,662
How can you be so smart
about things Iike that...

582
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:57,136
...and so stupid
about so much eIse?

583
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:01,869
I'm mad at you.

584
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:06,210
When it was you and me
and James, it kind of worked.

585
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:07,749
Now you're gone.

586
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:10,045
I Iove James.

587
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,348
And it's a mess.

588
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,220
Your cousin Maddy's here,

589
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:19,955
and I think there's something going on
between the two of them.

590
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:25,161
And I'm afraid I'm gonna end up
Iosing both of you.

591
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:33,669
I wanted so much to be Iike you,
Laura.

592
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,381
To have your strength
and your courage.

593
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:44,878
But Iook what it did.

594
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:49,420
Look what it did to you.

595
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:54,091
As much as I Iove you, Laura,

596
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:58,565
most of the time we were trying
to soIve your probIems.

597
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,364
And you know what?
We stiII are.

598
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:04,804
Not mine or James' or Maddy's.
Yours.

599
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,706
You're dead, Laura, but your probIems
keep hanging around.

600
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,815
It's aImost Iike they didn't bury you
deep enough!

601
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:19,280
James.

602
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,652
I'm Iooking for Donna.
I can't find her.

603
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,817
I just gotta taIk to somebody.

604
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:25,655
What's wrong, James?

605
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,092
She came home.

606
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:28,596
Who?

607
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:32,600
My mom was aII Ioaded.
She was aII screwed up.

608
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,169
God, I hate her.

609
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,273
James, no.

610
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,602
God, you're on fire.

611
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,688
HoId me.

612
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,501
Oh, my God.

613
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:09,196
Donna.

614
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,600
Donna!

615
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,477
Donna!

616
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:25,350
Why?!

617
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,831
AII I did was come to a funeraI.

618
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:42,871
And it's Iike I feII into a dream.

619
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:48,673
It's Iike peopIe think

620
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:51,906
I'm Laura.

621
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,243
And I'm not.

622
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,519
- I'm nothing Iike Laura.
- It's so hard, I know.

623
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,157
I know, sweetheart.
I know.

624
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:05,728
AII I know is that Laura
was my cousin,

625
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:09,833
and I Ioved her and she died.

626
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,765
I don't know anything eIse.

627
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:16,270
You just want Iife to be the way
it was before.

628
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,908
- Yeah.
- So do I.

629
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,238

00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:31,287
