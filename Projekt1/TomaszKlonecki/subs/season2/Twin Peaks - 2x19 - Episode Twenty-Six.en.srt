1
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,702
Nighttime or daytime,

2
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:39,573
once you get a few feet into this place,
you can't tell the difference.

3
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:43,341
Probably why it's all remained
so untouched.

4
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,951
One step at a time, gentlemen.
Keep your eyes peeled.

5
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:49,020
Over this way, to your right, Coop.

6
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,184
Harry,
someone's been here already.

7
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,919
Look, they did our work for us.

8
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,427
Oh, my God.

9
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,597
l saw the same tracks
outside the power station.

10
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,377
Weight shift to the left foot.
A break in the heel.

11
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,308
Windom Earle.

12
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,380
What would Earle be doing here?

13
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,178
That's a frightening question
to contemplate.

14
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:22,552
Andy, l'm gonna need

15
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,748
an accurate large-scale
rendering of this petroglyph.

16
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,486
Harry, let's get Major Briggs
on the horn.

17
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,219
You want him to meet us
at the station?

18
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:32,194
That's the ticket.

19
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,408
Once upon a time,

20
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:54,645
there was a place of great goodness

21
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,619
called the White Lodge.

22
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:02,922
Gentle fawns gamboled there
amidst happy, laughing spirits.

23
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:07,157
The sounds of innocence and joy
filled the air.

24
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:12,795
And when it rained, it rained
sweet nectar that infused one's heart

25
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:18,240
with a desire to live life
in truth and beauty.

26
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:24,674
Generally speaking, a ghastly place,
reeking of virtue's sour smell.

27
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,648
Engorged with
the whispered prayers

28
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,983
of kneeling mothers,
mewling newborns,

29
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:35,150
and fools, young and old,
compelled to do good without reason.

30
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:38,831
But l am happy to point out
that our story does not end

31
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:42,366
in this wretched place
of saccharine excess.

32
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:46,370
For there's another place.
lts opposite.

33
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,976
A place of almost
unimaginable power,

34
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:54,079
chock-full of dark forces
and vicious secrets.

35
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,684
No prayers dare enter
this frightful maw.

36
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,515
Spirits there care not for good deeds
or priestly invocations.

37
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,680
They are as like
to rip the flesh from your bone

38
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,258
as greet you with a happy good day.

39
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:11,329
And if harnessed,
these spirits in this hidden land

40
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,365
of unmuffled screams
and broken hearts

41
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,196
will offer up a power so vast

42
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,866
that its bearer might reorder
the earth itself to his liking.

43
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:30,506
Now, this place l speak of
is known as the Black Lodge.

44
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,380
And l intend to find it.

45
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,544
Hey, man,

46
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,451
the story's cool,

47
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:40,058
but you promised me beer.

48
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,194
You told me
there was gonna be a party.

49
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:48,631
l mean, White Lodge, Black Lodge?
l mean, what's the big deal?

50
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:54,831
ln time, young man.
Everything in time.

51
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:25,761
l think that l shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

52
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:29,600
When she walks into a room,

53
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:33,940
the flowers all stood up,

54
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,412
to room,

55
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,448
doom,

56
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,886
fume, gloom...

57
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:51,195
l think that l shall never see
a girl as lovely as Josie.

58
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:57,962
When she walks into a room,
the flowers were all abloom.

59
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:02,805
- Oh, Josie.
- Oh, stop your incessant moping.

60
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,705
Give me a hand with this damn box.

61
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,973
What exactly
would you like me to do?

62
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:14,010
Open it. l've been trying for days.

63
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,451
Thomas Eckhardt
left this to me when he died.

64
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:20,024
And l want it opened,
l want it opened now.

65
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,321
Well, let's have a look-see here.

66
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,861
Do you have a key?

67
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,432
lf l had a key, it would be open,
don't you think?

68
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:35,934
Well, it doesn't even have
a keyhole.

69
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:40,669
lt's a puzzle box.

70
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:45,841
l saw one of these
at a crafts emporium on Guam.

71
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,251
l was there taking a little R and R
with the Doolittle twins.

72
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,481
There was a monkey show
you wouldn't believe,

73
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,425
and Dale Doolittle--
Now, he was the larger of the two--

74
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,690
Come to think of it, for twins,
they weren't all that much alike.

75
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,959
Peter!

76
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,098
Sorry, poodle.

77
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:11,004
The trick is to fit the pieces together
just so.

78
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,702
And how long will it take?

79
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:19,275
Well, this could take years.

80
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:26,950
Shel, l've been doing a lot of thinking
about the future.

81
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:30,255
And what it takes
to get ahead in the world.

82
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,696
l'm reading up, watching TV,
suddenly it hits me:

83
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,761
The secret to success.

84
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,802
Beautiful people
get everything they want.

85
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,873
- Bobby.
- Yeah, think about it.

86
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,477
When's the last time you saw
a beautiful blonde

87
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,206
go to the electric chair?

88
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,910
You are very beautiful, Shelly.

89
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:59,214
And l think it's time we took advantage
of this beautiful people's conspiracy.

90
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,054
Know any senators l can marry?

91
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,152
Check it out.

92
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:07,431
Miss Twin Peaks.

93
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,263
Once we get that crown on your head,
baby, the sky is the limit.

94
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,497
Dream on, Bobby,
l have tables to wait on.

95
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,404
Shelly, listen, don't argue with me.

96
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,545
Bobby's in charge,
you understand?

97
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,447
We have to enlist
by this afternoon.

98
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,758
There's something
l want you to do for me, darling.

99
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:43,762
l'll do anything
that body and mind can stand.

100
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:48,273
Surely the last few days
have been proof of that?

101
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,635
You just name it.

102
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,974
l wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

103
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,949
You just name it.

104
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,683
l wanna win
the Miss Twin Peaks contest.

105
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,489
Oh, of course.

106
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,688
Well, l've been known
to make a speech or two in my time.

107
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,300
l'll coach you day and night.

108
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:19,899
Oh, now, sweetheart.
Baby, that's not what l'm talking about.

109
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,734
Now, you're one of the judges.

110
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,638
You can guarantee it.

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,311
But-- But...

112
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,540
lt would be wrong.

113
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,752
Well, now, darling--

114
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,048
Darling, it would be love.

115
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:39,225
That's all.

116
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,661
You know,
l'd do anything for you, Lana.

117
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,424
You know that.

118
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,534
Yes, lover, l do.

119
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:02,045
- Good morning, Annie.
- Hi. Breakfast?

120
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,910
l've got four hungry lawmen
out in the police cruiser.

121
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,951
We need donuts and coffee. Hot.

122
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,520
Two black, two white,
no sugars, please.

123
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,754
- Coming right up.
- Oh, and Annie?

124
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,790
l'd like to take this opportunity
to ask you

125
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:19,591
if you'd like to accompany me
on a nature study this afternoon?

126
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,125
Nature study?

127
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:25,066
Sure.

128
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,706
How wonderful.

129
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,673
What?

130
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,274
When l talk to you,
l get a tingling sensation

131
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,379
in my toes and in my stomach.

132
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,413
That's interesting.

133
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,315
l don't think
it has anything to do with coffee.

134
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,321
- l'll get those donuts.
- Thanks.

135
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,421
Shelly?

136
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,566
You are beautiful, got it?

137
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:57,100
Use it to your advantage.

138
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,768
''What is all this sweet work worth,

139
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,307
if thou kiss not me?''

140
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:05,739
l beg your pardon?

141
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,848
Oh, it was an anonymous poem
someone sent me.

142
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,678
Shelly,

143
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,752
l need to see this poem immediately.

144
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,584
Okay.

145
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,955
lt was in three pieces,
we each got a piece.

146
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,619
- Donna, Audrey and me.
- Thank you.

147
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,464
l need to keep this.

148
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,737
- Okay.
- Thank you.

149
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,442
A dozen donuts, four cups of coffee,
two black, two white, no sugar.

150
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,345
Thank you.

151
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,382
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

152
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:48,386
This afternoon?

153
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:52,549
l'll meet you right here.
Four o'clock sharp.

154
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,004
''Mountains kiss.

155
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,574
Waves clasp.

156
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,075
Flower...''

157
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,372
What's this all about?

158
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:19,178
lt's a poem, Harry. Torn into thirds.

159
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:23,846
Sent to Shelly Johnson, Audrey Horne
and Donna Hayward

160
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,354
from Windom Earle.

161
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,157
You mean Earle's contacted
all three girls?

162
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,496
Are you sure?

163
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:37,825
See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another

164
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:42,998
No sister-flower would be forgiven
lf it disdained its brother

165
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,340
A poem l once sent to Caroline.

166
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:50,181
l hope it's nothing more
than a taunt, Harry.

167
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:55,415
Earle takes perverse pride in his ability
to insinuate himself into innocent lives.

168
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,383
Well, let's talk to the girls
as soon as we can.

169
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,025
See what they remember.

170
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,728
Donna Hayward's poem.

171
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:13,299
Audrey Horne is in Seattle.
She won't be back till tomorrow.

172
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:16,203
Major Briggs is here
in the conference room.

173
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,933
Hawk?

174
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:23,479
Would you please bring me
Leo Johnson's arrest report?

175
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,850
Leo?

176
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,386
What's going on?

177
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:34,616
Putting the pieces together, Harry.

178
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,890
Deputy Brennan?

179
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,327
As l remember,
the line you are drawing

180
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,660
should proceed downward,
not across.

181
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,165
How did you know that?

182
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,363
Major Briggs?
Thank you, sir, for coming in.

183
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,767
Major, we need your help.

184
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:56,642
But l am unable to accurately
describe for you how or why.

185
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,483
Go on.

186
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,812
The Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department
is currently involved

187
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,887
in several disparate investigations.

188
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:06,287
The disappearance
of known felon, Leo Johnson.

189
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,926
The appearance
of my former partner

190
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,289
and suspected murderer,
Windom Earle.

191
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,624
And the discovery of petroglyphs
of an unknown origin

192
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:13,958
in a place called Owl Cave.

193
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,124
Now, it would seem
logic would dictate

194
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,465
that these investigations
be considered separate entities.

195
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,630
However, l believe otherwise.

196
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,139
l believe that these mysteries
are not separate entities,

197
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,279
but are in fact, complementary verses
of the same song.

198
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,880
Now, l cannot hear it yet.

199
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,778
But l can feel it.

200
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,441
And that is enough
for me to proceed.

201
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:35,553
How exactly may l help you?

202
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,548
l need to know everything
that there is to know

203
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,955
about Windom Earle's work
with Project Blue Book.

204
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,153
My security clearance was revoked
shortly after my disappearance.

205
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,492
And your ability to access
these Blue Book files?

206
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,659
Now, the issue is not one of access.

207
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:57,571
However, there are certain
moral judgments l must consider.

208
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:00,843
Yes, sir, l understand.

209
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:05,548
Will this information help you
to prevent future loss of life?

210
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,150
Most assuredly.

211
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:14,050
ls this a copy of the petroglyph
you found in Owl Cave?

212
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,824
Andy?

213
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,463
Sir.

214
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:20,591
Are you familiar with this?

215
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,035
Well, l've dreamed it.

216
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:27,539
Or seen it somewhere, somehow.

217
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,288
l will do what you ask.

218
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:59,628
- Leo Johnson's arrest report.
- Good work, Hawk.

219
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,805
Gentlemen,
the damage to Leo Johnson

220
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:09,038
would alter
certain handwriting characteristics.

221
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,275
However, the basic style
would remain the same.

222
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,326
This poem,

223
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:31,401
sent by Windom Earle,
was transcribed by Leo Johnson.

224
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,447
Mr. Horne.

225
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,442
Mr. Horne, as you are no doubt aware,
there are but scant hours

226
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,485
until our wine-tasting benefit begins

227
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:53,147
and l can't find
your daughter anywhere.

228
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,556
Audrey is in Seattle for the day.

229
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,425
However, l'm sure that our concierge
will be able to assist you.

230
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,157
The concierge.

231
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,768
Yes, capital.

232
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,096
Thank you, Mr. Horne.

233
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,705
Oh, Mr...

234
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,472
- Richard Tremayne.
- Tremayne, yes, right.

235
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,667
- Men's fashions.
- Men's fashions, of course.

236
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,176
Tell me,

237
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,549
how is your nose?

238
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,617
Oh, Mr. Horne, think nothing of it.

239
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:24,484
A nose is a small price to pay
in the service of a greater good.

240
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:30,284
Well, we will, of course,
pay any medical expenses.

241
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:32,995
How kind.

242
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,796
One might also think
workers' compensation

243
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:40,200
in some variety will be involved.

244
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:44,903
Easily done.

245
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,205
Capital, Mr. Horne.

246
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,815
l'll alert my attorney.

247
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,422
''l will alert my attorney.''

248
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:03,257
Sometimes the urge to do bad

249
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,364
is nearly overpowering.

250
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:22,737
Drink up, my friend. We celebrate.

251
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:28,283
Celebrate?
l can barely move my arms.

252
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,714
You have lived your short life
in odium and obscurity.

253
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,418
But now, at the last,

254
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,428
you will step upon the larger stage.

255
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:42,226
l must confess, l envy you.

256
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,892
Your journey begins
at a point beyond imagining.

257
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,630
Who knows where it might travel
from there?

258
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,570
l'm pumped.

259
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:53,769
Hey, is this for, like,
the Lilac Parade or what?

260
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,642
No, not a parade, my friend,
not exactly.

261
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:00,582
Well, l'm real cool
about helping out and everything

262
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:03,084
but how do l get out of this thing?

263
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,223
You don't.

264
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,256
Leo?

265
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,951
Fetch me an arrow.

266
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,061
Arrow?

267
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,464
Whoa, man.

268
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,696
l do not appreciate practical jokes.

269
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,138
Leo, the arrow?

270
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,346
No.

271
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,413
Jeez, don't zap the geek.

272
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,988
How am l supposed to get
my beer without--? You know.

273
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:43,623
Dude. That hurts.

274
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,035
Fetch me the arrow.

275
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:08,118
Thank you, Leo.

276
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,985
What's with the arrow, man?

277
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,962
What are you doing?

278
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,025
This isn't funny.

279
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,828
- Be still.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?

280
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,205
Think of all the hapless sinners

281
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:31,468
wondering where
their souls' destination lies.

282
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:33,704
For what?

283
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:36,381
To gain the answer
to a simple question.

284
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,883
Where will my spirit awake?

285
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:45,153
What life am l given after this life?

286
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,895
This grave question has plagued
man's sorry conscience for eons.

287
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:56,432
And now, you, you lucky boy.

288
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,599
You have the answer.

289
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,567
Now.

290
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,676
Miss Twin Peaks Judging and Rules
Committee is now in session.

291
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:20,086
You know, this year
is going to be very exciting.

292
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,061
- Now we--
- Very exciting.

293
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,594
This year is going to be
very, very exciting.

294
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:27,231
Thank you, Dwayne.

295
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,196
Now, first order of business.

296
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,598
Mr. Ben Horne has asked
to address the committee

297
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,294
as a friend of the committee.

298
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:36,566
l don't have any objection to that.

299
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,267
Address away, Ben.

300
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,072
Thank you.

301
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:46,851
And, Dwayne, let me congratulate you
on your recent engagement.

302
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,648
Thank you very much.

303
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:53,120
She's a lovely woman
and l wish you much happiness.

304
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,420
Well, thank you very much.

305
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:00,059
Gentlemen.

306
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,595
My purpose is simple.

307
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:08,673
The age of the ogling, swim-suited
jiggle festivals of the past is dead.

308
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,608
Miss Twin Peaks, l believe,
and rightly,

309
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:19,115
is now a celebration
of the totality of a woman's qualities.

310
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:22,276
Beauty has taken on
a broader definition

311
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:27,687
to include mind, spirit, values, ideas.

312
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,919
And for taking this step, gentlemen,

313
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,324
l applaud you.

314
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,825
What's he selling?
What are you selling?

315
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,526
Mr. Mayor, let me get
right to the point.

316
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,939
Miss Twin Peaks is an event
in search of a theme.

317
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,007
Now, what l propose is simple.

318
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:51,446
The topic of this year's speeches
should be how to save our forests.

319
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:59,022
lt's now, it's relevant,
it's global and it's...

320
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:03,361
Well, to put it plainly,
gentlemen, it's us.

321
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:10,697
Of course, your opposition
to the Ghostwood development plans

322
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,133
wouldn't have anything
to do with this?

323
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,000
Pete,

324
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,875
l resent your implication.

325
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:24,175
The environmental issues here
dwarf any parochial business concerns

326
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:29,252
that l, or you, or anyone else

327
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,184
might be pursuing.

328
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:34,848
We'll take it under advisement.

329
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,518
We'll take it under advisement.

330
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,561
That's the most
that l could hope for.

331
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:44,066
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.
Mr. Mayor.

332
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,169
He thinks he can pull a fast one.

333
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,400
The idea has merit.

334
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:53,204
The idea has merit.

335
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,039
l'm in favor of it myself.

336
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,279
- Bobby.
- Hey, chief.

337
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:01,680
Don't forget
the dry-cleaning, all right?

338
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,378
Thanks.

339
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,760
Will the first candidate
please approach the committee?

340
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:19,734
Lana? Come on up, honey.

341
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,913
Does anybody smell a fix here?

342
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:36,816
l can't do this, Bobby.

343
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,889
l have never made a speech before
in my life.

344
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:43,050
l read a book report in the fourth grade
in front of Mrs. Gardner's class

345
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:45,628
and l passed out
right in front of the whole room.

346
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,666
You'll do great, doll.
l'm gonna be your speech writer.

347
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:54,228
You're gonna be great.
Don't worry, okay?

348
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:02,342
-Here you go. Good luck.
-Donna? Are you entering too?

349
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:06,348
- Yeah, you too?
- Oh, l wouldn't miss it for the world.

350
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,077
- lsn't it exciting?
- Yes.

351
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,846
Yes.

352
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,183
Mike, it's a long time no see.

353
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,955
l'd ask where you've been
keeping yourself but l think l know.

354
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,532
- This is very scary, Mike.
- lt's not what you think.

355
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,636
lt's not what l think.
What do you think l think?

356
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:27,772
You think l'm going out
with an older woman.

357
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:34,271
l think l don't know where you got this
sudden interest in the life of fossils.

358
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,379
Yeah, but...

359
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:37,844
lt's not what you think.

360
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,812
Mike, big favor.

361
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:44,217
Clear this up for me.

362
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,947
l wouldn't expect you to understand.

363
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,650
l will strive to be understanding.

364
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,727
Do you have any idea

365
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,130
what a combination of sexual maturity

366
00:25:57,302 --> 00:26:00,237
and superhuman strength
can result in?

367
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,807
Sorry.

368
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:39,103
Catherine, if there's anything
you can tell me about her, anything--

369
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,372
Anything at all
that might help me understand.

370
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,276
For instance?

371
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,182
What made her do
the things she did?

372
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:50,548
What was she after?

373
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:54,283
l've been asking myself
a lot of the same things.

374
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,884
Catherine?

375
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,456
l need to understand.

376
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,929
l think that early in her life,
she must have learned the lesson

377
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:09,130
that she could survive by being
what other people wanted to see,

378
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:11,970
by showing them that.

379
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:16,076
And whatever was left
of her private self,

380
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,648
she may never have shown
to anyone.

381
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:23,220
- So all the stories, the lies were--?
- Well, who knows?

382
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:26,448
They may not have seemed
untrue to her.

383
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:32,759
What she needed to believe was
always shifting to suit the moment.

384
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,792
ln spite of all the things
she tried to do to me and my family,

385
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,939
l find it curiously hard
to hate her for it.

386
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,300
Well, she was...

387
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,443
She was so very beautiful.

388
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:59,821
There may be a clue
that could benefit both of us.

389
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,721
What's that?

390
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,461
Thomas Eckhardt left this to me
when he died.

391
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,431
lt occurred to me that it might have
something to do with Josie.

392
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,002
What's inside?

393
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:16,469
l don't know.
l haven't been able to open it.

394
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,302
Let me see.

395
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,546
- Well, there's no lid, there's--
- No.

396
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:26,309
There's no clasp.

397
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,350
Wowee, Bob.

398
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:33,286
Have we got some beauties
in the contest this year.

399
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,482
Hello, Harry.

400
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,561
Seems like every gal in town
is lined up to take a shot at the--

401
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:43,133
Say, have you had any luck
with this thing?

402
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,532
Butterfingers.

403
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,246
Holy moly.

404
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:57,075
What is it?

405
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:09,555
- Give it to me.
- Just a second, poodle.

406
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:21,805
Now, l held it just so.

407
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,425
l used to swim here every summer.
Two or three times a week.

408
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:51,562
Then l made a good choice.
lt's beautiful.

409
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:55,463
l always felt closer to nature
than l did to people.

410
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,132
- Why?
- l never had many friends.

411
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,778
Norma was always Miss Popularity.

412
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,040
She was always moving
toward the world.

413
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:05,740
And l was always
moving away from it.

414
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,614
- Lived in my head, mostly.
- That's not a bad neighborhood.

415
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,151
There's some pretty strange
neighbors.

416
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,886
- Many boyfriends?
- No.

417
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,086
Really?

418
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:21,131
Well, l had one.

419
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:22,561
High school?

420
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:23,860
Senior year.

421
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:28,871
Have anything to do
with why you went into the convent?

422
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,004
l'm sorry, do you mind
if we don't talk about it?

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,943
Not at all.
We can talk about whatever you'd like.

424
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:43,018
l wanna come back to the world.

425
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,122
l was so frightened for so long.

426
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,781
l understand.

427
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,189
Hiding from your fear
doesn't make your fear go away.

428
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,925
Makes it stronger.

429
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,996
So l had to face it.
l had to face myself.

430
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:03,903
And l had to do it here.
Where everything went so wrong.

431
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:19,184
Annie, l know how hopeless
things can seem.

432
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:24,955
l know about the dark tunnel
you can fall into.

433
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,495
lt happened before l went away.

434
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,529
lt happened because of that boy.

435
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,839
Something similar happened to me.

436
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,167
lt made me wanna disappear
from the world.

437
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:41,639
Because of that,
maybe l can help you.

438
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:57,184
- l don't know you very well.
- No.

439
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,096
l'm trying to learn
how to trust my instincts.

440
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:05,062
What are they saying?

441
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:09,506
Trust.

442
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,938
Good evening. Evening, all.

443
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:21,601
And welcome
to our oenophiliac soiree.

444
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,613
Another in a continuing series
of public events,

445
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,910
sponsored by Horne lndustries,

446
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:32,148
to benefit the Stop Ghostwood
Development movement.

447
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,450
Ono-what?

448
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,118
- Something to do with wine.
- And now,

449
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:40,363
to the tasting.

450
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,193
Lana, Lucy,

451
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:47,270
if you'd like to help me pour, please.

452
00:33:57,449 --> 00:34:01,681
Our first wines this evening
are reds.

453
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:05,345
There are some schools of thought
who, of course, say,

454
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:08,617
there are no other wines but reds.

455
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,454
Yes, Andy?

456
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:15,861
There are also white wines
and sparkling wines.

457
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,999
Thank you, Andy.

458
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,628
And now that we're all poured,
let us first examine--

459
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,798
Don't taste it yet, Andy,
for heaven's sake.

460
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,408
Spit it out.

461
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,176
Sorry.

462
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,044
That's all right.

463
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:37,347
That's what we're here for, to learn.

464
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,990
Now, to the wine.

465
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:43,725
We must first examine
the nose of the wine

466
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:46,989
to see what it can tell us
about its bouquet.

467
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,827
And we do that by...

468
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,565
By smelling.

469
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,868
Very good, Lana.

470
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:06,543
Lift the glass, thusly.

471
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:09,846
And while rolling the wine
vigorously around in the glass,

472
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:14,720
we breathe deeply and fully.

473
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,400
Very good.

474
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:30,098
And now, we take our first taste,
a big boisterous gulp.

475
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,776
And we roll it around
our entire palate.

476
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:34,172
And we try to reach

477
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:38,941
those little taste buds stuck
way far at the back of the tongue,

478
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,277
remembering not to swallow.

479
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,283
Excellent.

480
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:47,482
And now, we spit.

481
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:56,224
So he came slowly out of the shadows,
leaving the dead girl behind.

482
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:00,497
And l said, ''You take one more step
and l will ventilate you.''

483
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,002
And then what happened?

484
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,404
lt was a brief, but touching funeral.

485
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,445
Dale, glad l caught up with you.

486
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:12,445
Got the rental fired up outside
and about ready to hit the road.

487
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:15,484
Gordon, super
we caught you before you left.

488
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,779
- You hurry back.
- l will, Coop.

489
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,458
- Remember Annie?
- Of course l do.

490
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,322
This world of Twin Peaks seems
to be filled with beautiful women.

491
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:27,021
Although only one l can hear.

492
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:29,459
Join us for pie.

493
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,825
Love to.

494
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,429
- Annie?
- Thanks.

495
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,013
Three each.

496
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,050
- Shelly, do you mind if we share?
- No.

497
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:51,279
Coop, they say that love
makes the world go around.

498
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:55,358
Makes people who need people
the luckiest people in the world.

499
00:36:55,527 --> 00:37:00,191
Although they never said a doggoned
thing about a cure for hearing loss.

500
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:03,198
Shelly, you are a miracle worker.

501
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,632
And a goddess sent from heaven.

502
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:08,169
l'm a waitress in a diner.

503
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,500
l've never been compared
to a goddess before.

504
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,870
Well, Shelly,
you just don't know your own value.

505
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:17,743
Coop, she's a rare and precious
individual, don't you think?

506
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,178
l know what you mean, Gordon.

507
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:25,414
Shelly, turn around and face me
a moment before l lose my nerve.

508
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,649
l'm about ready
to leave Twin Peaks,

509
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,350
and l don't know
when l'm gonna return.

510
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,052
But l want you to know
that meeting you

511
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,720
has been more than a privilege.

512
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,060
lt's touched my heart.

513
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,169
And l know
that if l don't kiss you now,

514
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,170
l'm gonna regret it
the rest of my days.

515
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:45,876
Hey!

516
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,012
What the hell's going on?

517
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,183
You are a witnessing a front,
three-quarter view

518
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,876
of two adults
sharing a tender moment.

519
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,753
Acts like he's never seen
a kiss before.

520
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:02,682
Gordon?

521
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,626
Take another look, sonny,
it's gonna happen again.

522
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,200
All right, class,
what did that sip reveal for us?

523
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,706
What flavors are we enjoying?

524
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,239
Tastes kind of woody.

525
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,774
No, not really.

526
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,748
Anyone else? Lana?

527
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,581
- Banana?
- Yes.

528
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:38,456
There is a hint of banana.
That's the metachloric acid.

529
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,790
Very good.

530
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:44,362
- What else?
- Banana.

531
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,934
Chocolate.

532
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,866
Correct, Andy.

533
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:51,599
Why don't we just skip the wine
and have a banana split?

534
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,804
Let's take another sip, shall we?

535
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:01,748
Swallowing this time,
and see what else we can discern.

536
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,087
What else can we taste?

537
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,193
What other wonder
invites taste buds toward pleasure?

538
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,862
Gosh, Dick.

539
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,093
Well, l just never knew wine
could have so many different qualities.

540
00:39:17,268 --> 00:39:22,535
lt's amazing, isn't it?
A really good wine is like a symphony.

541
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:29,643
And what is your reaction, Lucy?

542
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:38,614
l'm pregnant.
l'm not supposed to drink.

543
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,312
Love is hell.

544
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,376
Sorry?

545
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:11,317
Love, it's hell.

546
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:16,326
The Hindus say,
love is a ladder to heaven.

547
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:21,429
The Hindus have also been known
to take hikes on hot coals

548
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,533
for recreational purposes.

549
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,396
Self-discipline.

550
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:28,432
Self-discipline and love?
There's a bad match.

551
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,267
Earthly love.

552
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,033
What other kind is there?

553
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,677
When you're in it,

554
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:35,277
no other.

555
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:38,943
lt hits you like an 1 8-wheeler,
doesn't it? And there's no relief.

556
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,414
lt makes you feel more alive.

557
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,849
lt makes you feel more
of everything.

558
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,112
Pain included.

559
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,557
Especially pain.

560
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:52,753
l can't stop thinking about her.

561
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,921
Sounds like
you've got a pretty serious case.

562
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:57,397
Brother, l'm roped,
tied and branded.

563
00:40:57,568 --> 00:40:59,263
She feel the same way?

564
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,302
Here's hoping.

565
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:07,537
How about you?
You on the critical list too?

566
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,878
Feels like someone's taking
a crowbar to my heart.

567
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,949
Hey, that's not bad.

568
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:18,077
No, l think it's been locked away
long enough.

569
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,419
That's good.

570
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,456
- Here's hoping.
- Here's to you.

571
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:29,596
- Mr. Wheeler? Telegram for you, sir.
- Thank you.

572
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,327
Thank you very much.

573
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,911
Damn.

574
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:44,910
- Bellman?
- Yes, sir.

575
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:47,050
Kindly tell the front desk
l'll be checking out.

576
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,549
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

577
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,422
See you.

578
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,150
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

579
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,274
Would you pass the peas, Donna?

580
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,943
Thanks.

581
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,208
- Mom, could l ask you something?
- Sure.

582
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,614
How do you know Benjamin Horne?

583
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:24,982
Eileen, l told Donna

584
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:28,990
about the Heal the Planet benefit
you're working on.

585
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,718
Heal the Planet?

586
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,226
l saw him at the house.

587
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:35,524
You drove to see him yesterday?

588
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:40,899
Yes, he's offered to give us
some time.

589
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,505
l know he favors
several local charities.

590
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:46,040
Well, that must have been it.

591
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,475
One of the local charities
must have sent Mom's roses.

592
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:53,641
Would you pass the peas, Donna?

593
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,082
l think roses are really romantic,
don't you?

594
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,486
Donna, pass your mother the peas.

595
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:09,663
How's school going?

596
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:11,926
Great.

597
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,867
All the girls are real excited
about Miss Twin Peaks.

598
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:19,942
Fine tradition.
l worked with the pageant for years.

599
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:21,670
l entered.

600
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,841
Really?

601
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:27,876
You never seemed
very interested before.

602
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,546
Well, l guess l just figured

603
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,780
l could use the scholarship money
to study overseas.

604
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:08,652
We thought at first
it might be a bomb.

605
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:12,990
We don't exactly have a bomb squad,
so Andy brought his metal detector.

606
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:16,257
lf it is a bomb, it's not metallic
and there's no ticking sound.

607
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:23,297
Harry, there was a time
when l could comprehend,

608
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:27,103
with a high degree of clarity,
Windom Earle's twisted logic.

609
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:30,975
But his actions of late
have left me completely bewildered.

610
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:34,242
He is changing the pattern
of the game board.

611
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:38,286
Any hope of deducing his next move
has evaporated.

612
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,822
Andy, would you please
direct everyone

613
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,654
well behind the police cruiser?

614
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:47,086
Harry, please stand back.

615
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:49,027
There could be plastic explosives
in there--

616
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,326
Agent Cooper wants everyone back
behind the cruiser.

617
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:53,333
--chemicals,

618
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:56,132
and whatever else
hell could imagine.

619
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,875
My greatest fear?

620
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,943
Windom Earle
merely condescends to logic.

621
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:10,316
Leaving us the task of unraveling
an insane man's terrifying caprice.
