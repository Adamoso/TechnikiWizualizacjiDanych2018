1
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:39,739
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

2
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:42,780
lt's your move.

3
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:46,009
Please put your heart into it,
will you?

4
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:49,212
l've noticed a certain tentative quality
in your thinking,

5
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:52,256
as if your mind were occupied
with issues

6
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,223
other than those on the board
before you.

7
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,852
Such preoccupation
not only weakens one's resolve,

8
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,556
but one's foresight as well.

9
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,634
A deadly failing in any match,
you must agree,

10
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:08,207
but in this particular contest,
quite disastrous,

11
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,606
as we play for grave stakes,

12
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:15,441
the likes of which
you have no doubt surmised.

13
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:19,579
Print your move in tomorrow's paper.

14
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,244
Or l will make it for you.

15
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,892
That tears it. Cooper,
I'm not Ietting you out of my sight.

16
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,223
Harry, if Windom wanted to kiII me,
I'd aIready be dead.

17
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,224
Yeah.

18
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:38,396
- Better get Pete on the horn.
- Right.

19
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,901
Lucy, caII Pete MarteII,
get him over here right away.

20
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,337
Then caII the paper.

21
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,310
Find out the Iatest possibIe deadIine
for tomorrow's personaIs coIumn.

22
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,710
Paper and Pete, got it.
l'll do it alphabetically.

23
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,316
She was beautifuI.

24
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:05,324
She was the Iove of my Iife, Harry.

25
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,195
Okay, Lucy.

26
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:16,172
Okay, yeah, just teII Harry
I'II be right there, okay?

27
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,867
Right.

28
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,628
Peter.

29
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,134
SaIt and pepper.

30
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,628
Coming right up, poodIe.

31
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:50,001
You two bring out the worst
in each other.

32
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:54,909
- Oh, Pete's a prince of a man.
- A court jester.

33
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,279
WeII, I've got to mosey.

34
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:17,036
Goodbye, you sweet Packards.

35
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:24,073
Oh, Catherine.

36
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:28,078
Catherine, I'd aIways have hoped
that time and age wouId meIIow

37
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,909
that tempest raging inside you.

38
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,552
Watching you two act
Iike the Hardy Boys

39
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,587
aIways brings on stormy weather.

40
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,290
What's happening with Ghostwood?

41
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,359
I taIked to the investors,
the meeting is set.

42
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,859
I Ieave for Paris tomorrow.

43
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,592
Oh, company.

44
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,567
Dear Josie...

45
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,372
I'm home, did you miss me?

46
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,906
Oh, she Iooked surprised.

47
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:08,880
- Poor Josie.
- Oh, she has her charms, though.

48
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,081
Yes, but not for Iong.

49
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,434
Come in.

50
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,570
- Hi, Harry.
- Save it, Hank.

51
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,816
What happened? Did you get up on
the wrong side of the bed this morning?

52
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,508
So I broke paroIe. Cry me a river.

53
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,648
You crossed the border into Canada.

54
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:45,117
You consorted with the drug deaIers
at Dead Dog Farm.

55
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,623
You tried to kiII somebody.

56
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,124
I'm charging you with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

57
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,198
WeII, I think it's safe to assume
that I was at the diner

58
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,098
the night that Leo was pIugged.

59
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,330
- But you're weIcome to caII--
- I got a witness.

60
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,941
Puts you at the scene
with a gun in your hand.

61
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,044
Harry, you obviousIy seem serious
about this,

62
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,706
so I'm going to propose a trade.

63
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,212
How about information
Ieading to the arrest

64
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,550
and conviction
of Andrew Packard's murderer?

65
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:21,793
Hank Jennings,
witness for the prosecution.

66
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,395
No deaIs.

67
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,225
You're teIIing me
you're more interested

68
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,664
in the attempted murder
of Leo Johnson, feIon,

69
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,326
than Andrew Packard?

70
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,631
How's that gonna sit
with your constituents?

71
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,707
You're through, Hank.

72
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,003
My guess is, Harry, not too weII.

73
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,670
EspeciaIIy once they find out
who pushed the button on Andrew

74
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,146
and that you're sIeeping with her.

75
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,358
Gee, I'm sorry.

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,494
Get him out of here.

77
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,186
Get him out of here!

78
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,465
Give me that.

79
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,600
This is the buIIet we removed
from you.

80
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,372
This is the one that was excavated
from the dead man's skuII.

81
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,711
Same buIIets, same gun, same kiIIer.
Let's go get her.

82
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,080
- AIbert, hoId your horses.
- Coop,

83
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:24,189
I appreciate any reIuctance you have
for busting your paI's oId Iady,

84
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,087
but the woman ventiIated you
and Ieft you for dead.

85
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,752
AIbert, I don't take it personaIIy.

86
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,795
What about the gIoves,
the powder tests?

87
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,864
News at 5.
AII right, fine, you're not mad,

88
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:37,025
but there's an epidemic
of muItipIe gunshot wounds

89
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:39,694
foIIowing this chick around.
She is a menace.

90
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,204
I'II taIk to her.

91
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,138
Maybe she'II confess, turn herseIf in.

92
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,809
Maybe she'II grow wings
and join the circus.

93
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,221
Randy, I've got a Iist
of aII our non-repeat guests.

94
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,562
We're gonna send them a speciaI
invitation to the Great Northern.

95
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,671
Your enthusiasm brings
a saIty tear to the eye.

96
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,136
However,

97
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,571
I think you wiII find my job requires
a IittIe more

98
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:19,644
than a tight sweater
and a perky attitude.

99
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:21,603
Randy, I'm Iearning the business.

100
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,272
Every week a different department.
I don't want your job.

101
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,783
Yes, I Iook forward
to your stint in housekeeping.

102
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,354
This came for you this morning.

103
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:36,193
Good Iuck, Miss Horne.
You'II need it.

104
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:54,878
Hi.

105
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:59,612
- I just checked into Room 21 5.
- CongratuIations.

106
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:03,114
Strange, they toId me at the front desk
I shouId taIk to you.

107
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,619
What is it I can do for you?

108
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,885
Sorry, thought you were working.

109
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,085
I am working.

110
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:13,188
I'm working, see?

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,862
I see.

112
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,695
Audrey.

113
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,298
- Horne?
- At your service.

114
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,137
CouId you send someone out
to the airport?

115
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,336
I'm traveIing with some
heavy equipment this trip.

116
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,037
Didn't have enough room in the van.

117
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,740
- What fIight were you on?
- My own.

118
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,014
On the jet out there.
ShouIdn't be hard to find.

119
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:40,655
Is there anything eIse I can do
for you, Mr. RockefeIIer?

120
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,923
No, thank you.

121
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,057
Yeah.

122
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,099
I have a picture of you.

123
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,568
You're wearing a IittIe dirndI skirt, got
a white apron on, you have pigtaiIs.

124
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,070
It's unbeIievabIy cute.

125
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,734
I don't wear dirndI.

126
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,742
You did then.

127
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,747
It was right here.
The Great Northern dining room.

128
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,418
If I cIose my eyes,
I can aImost see it.

129
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,591
LittIe Audrey Horne as Heidi.

130
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,860
WeII, anyway, it's unforgettabIe.

131
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,030
Heidi.

132
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,672
I was 1 0. Hey!

133
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,534
Thank you.

134
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,229
''Save the one you Iove.

135
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,235
PIease attend gathering of angeIs
tonight at the Road House, 9:30.''

136
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,815
Nadine?

137
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,748
Honey, what are you doing home
from schooI?

138
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,826
Are you feeIing poorIy?

139
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,792
Don't.

140
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,830
Don't what?

141
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,625
Oh, Eddie. We have to taIk.

142
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:33,634
Okay.

143
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,238
Mike and I are in Iove.

144
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,373
- In Iove?
- I hope you're not hurt.

145
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:50,122
I wouIdn't wanna hurt you
for anything in the worId.

146
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,849
Honest, you have to beIieve that.

147
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,657
But Mike and I, on that wrestIing trip,

148
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:03,196
we had the most
magicaI night together.

149
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,467
AII night?

150
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:10,499
WeII, you and Norma did it.

151
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,773
WeII, that's fair.

152
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,181
So, what's this mean?

153
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,517
Eddie.

154
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:28,717
We have to caII a spade a spade.

155
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:32,060
We're breaking up.

156
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,992
Eddie,

157
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,666
I'm so sorry.

158
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:51,940
Josie, I want you to IeveI with me
about what happened in SeattIe.

159
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:53,745
I toId you.

160
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,388
How many times
do I have to say it?

161
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:59,684
I escaped from Jonathan
in the airport

162
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,953
and I don't know
what happened to him after that.

163
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,064
Do you understand
I couId arrest you right now?

164
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,427
I came here as a friend of Harry's.

165
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:11,868
Now, I don't know what pIace
he occupies in your heart,

166
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,973
but I do know that you own his.

167
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:18,269
I wouId think you'd Iike a chance
to expIain yourseIf to him.

168
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,275
PIease go.

169
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:32,618
This is the end of it, Josie.
There are no other options.

170
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:39,458
I want you at the station house
by 9:00.

171
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,862
Or I come and find you.

172
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:55,836
Oh, Josie,
I just saw Agent Cooper Ieave.

173
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,949
Was this a sociaI caII?

174
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:08,525
Dear, you Iook awfuI.

175
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,695
Is everything aII right?

176
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:15,356
- I don't feeI very weII.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

177
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,969
I wish I had better news.

178
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:20,662
I've spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again
on your behaIf.

179
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,603
WhiIe he's not
entireIy unsympathetic,

180
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,505
he does insist on seeing you aIone.

181
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,509
Tonight.

182
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,811
He'II kiII me.

183
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,541
To teII you the truth,

184
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,616
my biggest worry is
what he's going to do

185
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:37,517
when he finds out
that Andrew is aIive.

186
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,853
Won't Mr. Eckhardt think
that you've betrayed him?

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,287
But of course, you can teII him
that you didn't.

188
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,228
After aII, you did actuaIIy think
that Andrew was dead.

189
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,067
Oh, no.

190
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:56,469
I don't know. I don't know.

191
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:01,642
Maybe you can heIp me.
I think I'm going mad.

192
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,347
You wiII simpIy have to face
Mr. Eckhardt

193
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,648
sooner or Iater.

194
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,391
TeII him the truth.

195
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:17,554
TeII him whatever you want.

196
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:27,472
Just pray that he beIieves you.

197
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,506
Oh, there they are.

198
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,236
No answer. He must be on his way.

199
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:09,745
Thanks, Bobby.

200
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,076
Look, why don't you join us?

201
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

202
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:19,121
You know, board meetings are usuaIIy
nothing more than a gathering

203
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,157
of seIf-minded individuaIs,

204
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,955
each more intent
than the other on financiaI gain.

205
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,427
No, thank you.

206
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,327
But today...

207
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:31,100
Today is going to be
something compIeteIy different.

208
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:37,337
Am I Iate? Hot dog, Ben,
Iook at you. How are you?

209
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,078
- You are a sight for sore eyes.
- Look who's taIking.

210
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,615
- We taking good care of you?
- The best.

211
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,753
My Iuggage arrived.
Thank you, Audrey.

212
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,347
- You two have met?
- BriefIy.

213
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,650
John Justice WheeIer.

214
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,523
Used to be in construction.

215
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,756
- Came up the hard way.
- How nice.

216
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,433
You remember my brother Jerry?

217
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,626
- That is Jerry. Oh, my God.
- Hi, Jack.

218
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:09,608
And this is my executive assistant,
Bob Briggs.

219
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,470
- Bob.
- Hey, what's up?

220
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,807
- PIeasure.
- Why don't you aII just take a seat?

221
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:21,645
I've asked Mr. WheeIer
to join us on the board.

222
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:26,648
Years ago,
I made an investment in him,

223
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,191
a pittance,

224
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,795
which he buiIt into an empire.

225
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:34,399
Now, I don't take any credit,

226
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,397
but I beIieved in Jack

227
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:42,404
even when he was a IocaI boy
pounding naiIs.

228
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:47,011
I've asked him to return the favor
and beIieve in me now.

229
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:51,180
Ben, you're testing
my weII-worn modesty.

230
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,982
AII right, suffice to say,

231
00:17:56,155 --> 00:18:01,149
Horne Industries Incorporated
have faIIen on hard times.

232
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,760
The miII,

233
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,887
the Ghostwood Iands, are now
soIeIy owned by Catherine MarteII.

234
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,762
We don't begrudge her,
the miII was and is, after aII, hers.

235
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,995
So,

236
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,833
in spite of these reversaIs

237
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,671
and stripped of aII the trappings
of success,

238
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,142
what are we Ieft with?

239
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:24,449
The human spirit.

240
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,857
What is the greatest gift

241
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:36,791
that one human being can give
to another?

242
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,692
The future.

243
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,597
I give you...

244
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:54,170
...the IittIe pine weaseI.

245
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:58,877
Found onIy in our tri-county area,

246
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,776
it is nearIy extinct.

247
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:04,547
They're incredibIe roasted.

248
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:09,389
According to an environmentaI
impact report,

249
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:13,962
what few pine weaseIs remain
wiII be aII but wiped out

250
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,591
with the Packard pIans
for Ghostwood deveIopment.

251
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:21,739
So you wanna save the weaseI?

252
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,000
No, Bobby.

253
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,276
Not just the weaseI.

254
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:31,510
But Iife as we know it.

255
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,151
I want Twin Peaks

256
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,846
to remain unspoiIed

257
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:42,255
in an era
of vast environmentaI carnage.

258
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:46,488
So we bIock Catherine's deveIopment
untiI the wheeI turns

259
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:47,962
and we get another shot.

260
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,034
That's briIIiant, Ben. That's briIIiant.

261
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:54,502
I pIan to fight

262
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:57,836
this Ghostwood deveIopment
on every ground

263
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,377
and with every avaiIabIe weapon.

264
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:06,147
The IittIe pine weaseI...

265
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:11,553
...is about to become
a househoId word.

266
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:15,550
Then what?

267
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:22,959
Then I am considering

268
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,535
a run for the Senate.

269
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,842
Thank you.

270
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,425
Annie, it's no probIem.
I've got pIenty of room.

271
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:52,520
You just get on the next bus, okay?
And I'II be waiting.

272
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,796
Oh, honey, don't cry.

273
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,196
It's gonna be aII right.

274
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,235
I'II see you soon.

275
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:02,265
I Iove you too.

276
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,170
Bye.

277
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:09,114
- So your sister coming?
- Tomorrow.

278
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,318
God, what do you have to do
to get out of a convent?

279
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,086
You just Ieave, it's not a prison.

280
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:20,521
Sounds Iike prison to me.
No TV, no boyfriends.

281
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,254
You know, when she was IittIe,
I aIways used to think

282
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,592
that Annie was
from another pIace and time.

283
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,734
I guess the convent has been good
for her in a way.

284
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:33,102
Hard to imagine her out in the worId.

285
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:37,265
Oh, Iook, here's something for you.

286
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:40,879
- Who from?
- I guess who was ever sitting there.

287
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:46,781
Look at this.

288
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,817
''Mountains kiss, waves cIasp.

289
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:52,754
FIower, sunIight, the moonbeams,
is aII this, thou kiss.''

290
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,222
None of this makes sense.

291
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,924
''Save the one you Iove.

292
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,498
PIease attend a gathering of the angeIs
tonight at the Road House, 9:30.''

293
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,235
Sounds intriguing in a way,

294
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,995
but it sounds dangerous.

295
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,107
I wonder who this is from.

296
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,355
Norma Jennings, I've Ioved you
every day for the past 20 years

297
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,961
and I dream about you every night.

298
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,325
It's time for us to be together.

299
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,592
WiII you marry me?

300
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,861
- Ed?
- We deserve to be happy.

301
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,598
It's our turn, baby.

302
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,536
All night long l held her in my arms

303
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:24,376
Just to keep her
From the foggy, foggy dew

304
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,916
Good job, feIIa.

305
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:29,452
Good boy.

306
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:33,920
Just a few more, and then we'II eat.

307
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:38,757
Fly to my breast,
Pierce me in colors autumnal,

308
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:42,730
speak to me only of love.

309
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,267
Leo, you have
an incompIete education.

310
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:49,441
For instance,
survivaI in the wiIderness?

311
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:51,872
A reIevant issue in your Iife,
my friend.

312
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:57,539
Now, this comes under the heading
of practicaI instruction.

313
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,685
I hope you've been paying attention.

314
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:05,779
Nature is crueI.

315
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,257
This is aIso a Iesson.

316
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:30,081
Hi, honey.

317
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,410
How are you feeIing?

318
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,083
Oh, great, now that you're here.

319
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,817
Hank, I came here
to ask you for a divorce.

320
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:49,894
WeII, first Iet me say,
I don't bIame you.

321
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,593
You gave me a second chance
and I bIew it.

322
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,574
I don't know
why I'm so seIf-destructive,

323
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,675
but I can see

324
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,779
that that's my priority in getting weII.

325
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,971
I got a Iot of work to do.

326
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:05,912
In fact, I decided

327
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,746
I'm gonna try to go into therapy.

328
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,615
I don't wanna be Iike this anymore.

329
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,357
That's very interesting, Hank.

330
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:19,354
But I have to get on with my Iife.

331
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:24,567
I know.

332
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,197
I know you do.

333
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:30,864
I just want you to be happy.

334
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:32,973
Thank you.

335
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:38,950
I want you to do me one Iast favor.

336
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,349
I want you to heIp me
get out of here.

337
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,989
If they send me back to prison,
I'II die.

338
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:48,156
TeII the sheriff
that I was at the restaurant

339
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,386
the night
that Leo Johnson was shot.

340
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:53,861
I was on my way home.
I can't prove it, but you can.

341
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,659
No more Iies, Hank.

342
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,632
It's not Iying,
it's trying to save my Iife.

343
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,798
No.

344
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,174
You're kiIIing me here, Norma.

345
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:09,169
Don't bIame this on me.
Don't you dare.

346
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,410
Is it Ed?

347
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,016
Is that who you're running to?

348
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,652
Okay.

349
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:21,823
Then here's the deaI.

350
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:26,864
You give me my aIibi
and I give you your divorce.

351
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:29,898
I didn't come here
to negotiate with you.

352
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,729
This is it, it's over.

353
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,700
Fine.

354
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,571
Go ahead.

355
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:42,343
You're his whore, Norma.

356
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:49,419
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife.

357
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,590
Norma!

358
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,160
Norma!

359
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,299
Now, there are four or five
different ways of doing this thing,

360
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,436
and they aII have their virtues.

361
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:09,597
I remember CapabIanca and Lasker,

362
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,300
St. Petersburg, 1 91 4--

363
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,876
- Pete.
- Yeah.

364
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,707
We've onIy got five minutes.

365
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,906
AII right.

366
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:20,879
- Lucy.
- Sheriff?

367
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,281
Get the Gazette on the phone.

368
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,888
TeII them not to cIose out
the personaIs. We need more time.

369
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,924
- The Gazette.
- Okay.

370
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,791
That's it.

371
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:34,721
Guaranteed to cause
some sIeepIess nights.

372
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,164
As Iong as he can't remove
another piece from the board.

373
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,931
He can't do it.
Not at Ieast for five, six more moves.

374
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,074
Maybe he'II kiII anyway.

375
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:46,233
- Maybe it'II just frustrate him.
- I don't think so, Harry.

376
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:49,107
EarIe has a perverse sense of honor
about these things.

377
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:52,773
I never heard of a man
who murdered by the ruIes.

378
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:54,316
Coop?

379
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,215
AIbert.

380
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,515
Good work, Pete.

381
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:06,756
Here it is, straight up.

382
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,994
I got a match on the gun that
whacked you with the powder residue

383
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,692
on Josie Packard's gIoves.

384
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,929
SeattIe poIice have aIso
come up with an eyewitness

385
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:17,132
who positiveIy ID'd Josie Ieaving
the car where they found the stiff.

386
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,833
If you ain't gonna bust this bitch,

387
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:22,970
- I wouId consider it a personaI--
- AIbert, I can handIe it.

388
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,318
I think you just did.

389
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:49,668
Come in.

390
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,349
I assume
you stiII have a taste for bubbIy.

391
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,082
We've kiIIed enough bottIes
in our time.

392
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,052
To beginnings.

393
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:14,790
And endings, and the wisdom
to know the difference.

394
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,364
I am sorry, Andrew.

395
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,569
I hated you at first, of course.

396
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,302
PerfectIy normaI response.

397
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:34,581
As my anger diminished,

398
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:38,712
I recaIIed that Eckhardt has a way
of persuading peopIe to do anything.

399
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,519
- It was his idea, of course.
- Yes.

400
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:45,426
He made me do it.

401
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,960
And he said you never Ioved me.

402
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:51,068
You just married me
to get back at him.

403
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,930
That's not true,
I did Iove you very much.

404
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,864
Of course,
the same cannot be said for you.

405
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,374
PIease, Josie,

406
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:02,069
Iet there be no more Iies between us.

407
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:06,977
You had a job to do and you did it.
Now you're paying the price.

408
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,552
Every action has its consequence,
my dear.

409
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,451
The poIice are cIosing in.
If you don't take action,

410
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,651
you'II be sIeeping in a jaiI ceII tonight.

411
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,490
What can I do? PIease heIp me.

412
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,392
You must see Eckhardt.

413
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:27,132
Perhaps you were meant
to be together aII aIong.

414
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,437
I'm sure he truIy Ioves you.

415
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:36,175
He doesn't know I'm aIive.
He can get you out of this country.

416
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,812
Go to him, Josie.

417
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,749
Now.

418
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,929
Andrew.

419
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,028
We won't speak again.

420
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:15,817
Hi.

421
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,716
Hi.

422
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,448
It's beautifuI.

423
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:24,287
I wanted us to go somepIace
we've never been before.

424
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,560
Come on.

425
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,858
How did it go with the poIice?

426
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:34,130
They asked a miIIion questions
that I didn't know the answers to.

427
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:37,298
But the ones I did
must have been enough.

428
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,634
EveIyn's gonna stand triaI
and I'II be a witness.

429
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:45,816
You're not wearing the ring.

430
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,452
I know about you and EveIyn.

431
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:53,390
I wouIdn't bIame you
if you hated me.

432
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,688
James,
I know what you were feeIing.

433
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:00,194
I was feeIing it too.

434
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,595
EveIyn just took advantage of it.

435
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,498
WeII, it was wrong
and I shouId've known that.

436
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,699
Look, it's okay for you to feeI bad
about what happened to you,

437
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,901
but I don't want you to feeI bad
for me.

438
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,239
If we couId just start over again...

439
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,742
PIease come home with me.

440
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,216
I can't. Not right now.

441
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:32,757
You're right. You shouId go.

442
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,429
But what about you?

443
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:40,298
Can't worry about me anymore.

444
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,702
I've been a part
of aII the horribIe things

445
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,705
that have happened.

446
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:47,902
I wanna be a part
of something good now.

447
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:51,614
James, go.

448
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:54,376
Take aII the time you need.

449
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,452
I Iove you.

450
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,590
I'm gonna miss you Iike crazy.

451
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:04,060
But you'II go away

452
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:06,094
and you'II come back
with great stories.

453
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:11,566
And none of them are gonna be
about Laura or Maddy or EveIyn.

454
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,598
And I'II be here.

455
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:19,634
- Come with me.
- No.

456
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,983
WeII, then, I'II come back, I promise.

457
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,613
Coming.

458
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,719
Coming.

459
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,902
- Pete, I need to see Josie.
- Come on in.

460
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:22,198
- I think she's gone out.
- Yes, it's rather odd.

461
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:24,171
She took my car
without saying a word.

462
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,503
WeII, she toId me
the Great Northern.

463
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,402
Oh, did she? WeII,
she took a Iot of things with her.

464
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:30,911
I don't know where she was going.

465
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:34,085
But I'd say she was pIanning
to stay a whiIe.

466
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,015
What eIse did she say, Pete?

467
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,646
WeII, that she was going to see
an oId friend.

468
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,256
Who?

469
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:48,257
Sheriff, I suppose it's been very hard
on aII of us

470
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,697
Iearning the truth about Josie.

471
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:54,504
Catherine.

472
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:56,071
Who?

473
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:01,009
Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt.

474
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,444
Poor man.

475
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:20,091
Lobby, pIease.

476
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,467
Thomas.

477
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,743
We meet again.

478
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:37,180
I don't beIieve in ghosts.

479
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:39,441
Pity, it's an appeaIing notion.

480
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:43,109
The return of the grisIy phantom
from the grave.

481
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:46,189
You deserve haunting, to be sure.

482
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:49,556
Look cIoser, Thomas.

483
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,218
I'm aIive.

484
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:55,426
How?

485
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,125
Guess. It's reaIIy very simpIe.

486
00:35:59,304 --> 00:36:00,498
Josie.

487
00:36:01,573 --> 00:36:03,438
She warned me off herseIf.

488
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:07,066
CouIdn't bear to see
her beIoved husband perish.

489
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:08,735
Or more reaIisticaIIy, I suppose,

490
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,108
she feIt there was
some advantage to be gained.

491
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,573
She betrayed me.

492
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,652
We're aII famiIiar with betrayaI.

493
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,990
Josie is mine. She beIongs to me.

494
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:26,789
Oh, Thomas,
Iove wiII break your heart.

495
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:31,166
HappiIy, Iong ago, I Iost interest.

496
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:36,439
But Josie Ioses her heart
with aIarming reguIarity.

497
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,338
The IocaI sheriff, of aII peopIe.

498
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:42,503
- I have taken care of that.
- I don't doubt it.

499
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,317
Sometimes I wonder
if our Josie

500
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:50,045
does these twisted things
deIiberateIy.

501
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:52,051
Don't you?

502
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:57,290
As someone
who was once your friend,

503
00:36:57,462 --> 00:37:00,056
I come back with a warning.

504
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,363
Josie is coming back to you,
be very carefuI.

505
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,667
I'm aIways carefuI.

506
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:12,337
WeII, here we are, the Iobby.

507
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,708
I'II be going back down
to the garage.

508
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:18,280
My resurrection remains
a weII-kept secret.

509
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:26,217
Thomas.

510
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,360
Bye.

511
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:40,428
I know that I have a Iot to Iearn.

512
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,039
Jack,

513
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,607
you shaII be my teacher.

514
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,576
Think of me as an open book,

515
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:54,514
upon whose virgin pages
you shaII scribe.

516
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,750
You okay?

517
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:05,060
So, Mr. WheeIer,
what is it exactIy you do do?

518
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:07,129
First off, caII me Jack, pIease.

519
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,699
I buy bankrupt, faiIing businesses.

520
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,893
I streamIine them,
bring them back up to speed

521
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:15,266
and then usuaIIy seII them.

522
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,964
At a substantiaI profit.

523
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,631
But not, I shouId add,

524
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,903
before making significant
environmentaI concessions.

525
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,575
No, when Jack is finished,
the waste is rerouted, the air...

526
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:35,893
The air is cIeaner.

527
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,493
And the peopIe happier.

528
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:40,495
Ben, you make me sound
Iike Santa CIaus.

529
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:43,133
I'm a businessman, that's aII.

530
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:51,632
You'II have to excuse me,
the chef just tried to stab Jerry.

531
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,777
You kids carry on.

532
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,674
Pay attention.

533
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,986
So, Mr. WheeIer,

534
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:06,988
which is it,
are we bankrupt or just faiIing?

535
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,888
I came to do an oId friend a favor.
And it's Jack.

536
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:13,029
My father's friends are rarer
than the pine weaseI.

537
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,526
WeII, Iet's just say

538
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,827
that Ben was once
a very good friend to me.

539
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:20,802
So you came back
to bring us aII up to speed.

540
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:24,499
You are Santa CIaus, Mr. WheeIer.
I'd better hang up my stocking.

541
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,606
You don't Iike me very much,
do you, Audrey?

542
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,941
I don't have an opinion either way.

543
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,651
But if you did?

544
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,952
If I did,

545
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:43,116
I'd say that the Hornes have managed
to take care of themseIves just fine

546
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,693
for more years than you can count.

547
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,692
And desperate
though we may seem,

548
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:50,561
wiII probabIy continue to do so
in the foreseeabIe future.

549
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,634
Indeed.

550
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:05,038
Where have you been aII this time?

551
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:08,185
I mean, when you weren't busy
rescuing widows and orphans

552
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:11,219
and making our worId
a better pIace to Iive in.

553
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,881
The far corners of the earth.

554
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,227
I teII you, it's gIorious out there,
Audrey.

555
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:25,767
AII in aII, it's good to be home.

556
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:31,701
I'm onIy 1 8.

557
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,036
And what exactIy does that have to do
with the price of eggs?

558
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:38,982
Nothing.

559
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:44,086
God, Iook at the time.
I have an appointment.

560
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,416
- CouId you teII my father?
- Sure.

561
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,559
Okay. See you.

562
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,186
Bye.

563
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,360
I'II see you Iater, Jack.

564
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:03,131
I'II see you, Audrey.

565
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,319
- SheIIy? Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

566
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,154
I'm okay. How are you doing?

567
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:27,229
You know Iife. Drag?

568
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,763
Are you waiting for James?

569
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:31,231
No.

570
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:34,235
ActuaIIy I got this reaIIy weird note.

571
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:36,805
Somebody wants me
to meet them here.

572
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,965
That strange?

573
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,404
That is strange, Iook what I have.

574
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,581
It Iooks Iike we aII have something
to taIk about.

575
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,281
It fits.

576
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:54,691
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another

577
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,989
No sister-flower would be forgiven
lf it disdain'd its brother

578
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:03,327
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea--

579
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:08,097
What is all this sweet work worth,
lf thou kiss not me?

580
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,305
- This is weird.
- I'II say.

581
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:34,831
Cooper here. Yes, Catherine.

582
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:38,196
No, no, I was just on my way over.

583
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:40,397
She's here?

584
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:43,537
Thomas Eckhardt's suite.

585
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,204
I see.

586
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:01,887
HeIp!

587
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,750
- PIease heIp.
- I Iove you.

588
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:06,328
- No!
- Josie, pIease. For God's sake--

589
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:09,898
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!
Don't hurt me.

590
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:35,786
Stay where you are.

591
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,433
He tried to kiII me.

592
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:50,264
Is that what you'II say about me,
Josie? That I tried to kiII you?

593
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,266
What about Jonathan?

594
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,105
Did he try to kiII you too?

595
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,544
He was taking me back.

596
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,984
Why did you shoot me, Josie?

597
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,084
Because you came here.

598
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:06,587
I knew this day was going to come.

599
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:09,749
I'm not going to jaiI. I can't.

600
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:13,619
Put it down, Josie.

601
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:18,694
- Harry.
- Put it down!

602
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:21,838
Harry, forgive me.

603
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:24,497
I never meant to hurt you.

604
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:41,086
Josie. Josie.

605
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,020
Josie.

606
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,289
She's dead.

607
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,135
Josie.

608
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:14,552
Coop, what happened to dead Josie?

609
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,383
Oh, Josie.

610
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:59,335
Oh, Josie.
