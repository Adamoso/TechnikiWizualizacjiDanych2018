1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
The short answer is, this is the work
of the same ghoul who killed Laura.

2
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,700
More fan mail.

3
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,800
The letter O
under Maddy's ring fingernail.

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
There were strands of fur
clutched in her right hand.

5
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
- What kind of fur?
- White fox.

6
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,600
The strands were laced with
formaldehyde. A dead animal, stuffed.

7
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
l'll make phone calls. Leland will know
how to get a hold of Maddy's family.

8
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Harry, don't make any calls.

9
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,600
- l need 24 hours.
- For what?

10
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
To finish this.

11
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
Cooper.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
ln observation...

13
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,800
...l don't know where this is headed.

14
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,900
But the only one of us
with coordinates

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
for this destination and its hardware
is you.

16
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Go on whatever vision quest
you require.

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,100
Stand on the rim of the volcano,
stand alone and do your dance.

18
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Just find this beast
before he takes another bite.

19
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
God help me,
l don't know where to start.

20
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,100
You're on the path.
You don't need to know where it leads.

21
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Just follow.

22
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,600
l thought you'd never get here.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
l went for a ride this morning.

24
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
God, the engine sounded like
a thousand people singing.

25
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,100
- What were they singing about?
- What do you think?

26
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,600
Last night?
l could sing about last night.

27
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,900
l got something for you.

28
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,200
Open it.

29
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Oh, James.

30
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
l didn't know what size to get.

31
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,200
And the girl at the jewelry store
had these really big hands.

32
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
But l'll bet...

33
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
Perfect.

34
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
James.

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,500
l just think we should
be together all the time.

36
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,800
Really?

37
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
lf that's okay with you.

38
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,200
lt's perfect.

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Whatever fowl
did you take these eggs from?

40
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,400
Are we saying we don't like it?

41
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,600
l'm afraid l'm gonna
run into a thumbtack.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Mother, can't you ever say
anything nice?

43
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,100
l've tried so hard.
l try so hard,

44
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,700
and nothing is good enough for you.

45
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,800
Let me correct myself, nothing l do
is ever good enough for you.

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, that's not true.
The menus are very presentable.

47
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,900
Oh, l'm joking.

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,900
Honestly,
let me make a suggestion.

49
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,500
lf you wanna serve
a truly memorable omelet

50
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,600
try white veal sausage
and morel mushrooms.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,400
Thanks. l'll go pick the mushrooms.

52
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,000
What did you say?

53
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,500
Nothing.

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Hello, Donna.

55
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,900
Hello, James.

56
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,900
What did you say?

57
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,400
- lt's French.
- l know it is, tell me.

58
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,600
Donna, what's the big deal?

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,300
You know Mrs. Tremond?

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
- Miss who?
- Mrs. Tremond.

61
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,700
Her grandson does the magic tricks.
He told me this.

62
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
But it was Mr. Smith.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,300
- Harold?
- He left a suicide note.

64
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,300
You know, it means,
''l am a lonely soul.''

65
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,400
l have to find Agent Cooper.

66
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,500
Donna, what's going on?

67
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Hey.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Mrs. Tremond's the one
who told me about Harold Smith.

69
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,200
She has a grandson
and he said this to me.

70
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,100
The same words that are in
Harold Smith's suicide note.

71
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Maybe the boy
said the same thing to Harold.

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,900
No, Harold's world was in his words.

73
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,300
The suicide note has to be
a message.

74
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,600
lt all leads back here.

75
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,200
She's pretty old. lt might take a second
if her grandson isn't here.

76
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,900
- May l help you?
- ls Mrs. Tremond home?

77
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,200
l'm Mrs. Tremond.

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
lt must have been your mother
l spoke to.

79
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,300
My mother?
She passed away three years ago.

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,900
l live here alone, honey.

81
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,100
No, she was here. l spoke to her.
And her grandson, he was here too.

82
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
But l have no children.

83
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
But he was here.
They both were.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Donna, we'd better go.

85
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,900
Donna?
Are you Donna Hayward?

86
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,300
- Yeah.
- Just a moment.

87
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
l've never seen her before in my life.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
l thought you delivered meals here.

89
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,900
The morning after poor Harold died,
l found this in my mail.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
l meant to turn it in.

91
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,000
lt's for you.

92
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you.

93
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,500
- lt's Harold's handwriting.
- Open it, Donna.

94
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,100
lt's Laura's diary,
a page from her diary.

95
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,600
Read it.

96
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,800
''February 22nd.

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Last night l had
the strangest dream.

98
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
l was in a red room
with a small man dressed in red

99
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,600
and an old man sitting in a chair.

100
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,200
l tried to talk to him.

101
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,000
l wanted to tell him who Bob is
because l thought he could help me.

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
My words came out slow and odd.

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,100
lt was frustrating trying to talk.

104
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
l got up and walked to the old man.

105
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,700
Then l leaned over and whispered
the secret in his ear.

106
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,700
Somebody has to stop Bob.

107
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Bob's only afraid of one man,
he told me once.

108
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
A man named Mike.

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,100
l wonder if this was Mike
in my dream.

110
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Even if it was only a dream,
l hope he heard me.

111
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,600
No one in the real world
would believe me.

112
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,800
February 23rd.

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,100
Tonight is the night that l die.

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
l know l have to
because it's the only way

115
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
to keep Bob away from me.

116
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
The only way to tear him out
from inside.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
l know he wants me,
l can feel his fire.

118
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,600
But if l die,
he can't hurt me anymore.''

119
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,000
Laura and l had the same dream.

120
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,400
- That's impossible.
- Yes, it is.

121
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Deputy, take Donna home.

122
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,800
l got to see Gerard.

123
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
He's completely dehydrated.

124
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,400
His breathing is becoming
more difficult. He needs that drug.

125
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,900
Mike.
Mike, l need you to talk to me.

126
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,300
- Any longer could kill him.
- Mike.

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Bob has killed again.

128
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
l need to know something.
l need you to help me.

129
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,500
Bob was in my dream, Laura Palmer
was in my dream, so were you.

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,600
And Laura dreamt about me
the night before she died.

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,300
The same dream that l had.

132
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
l need to unlock that.
l need-- The answer is inside of me.

133
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,300
Bob and l,
when we were killing together,

134
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,200
there was this perfect relationship,

135
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,300
appetite,

136
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,200
satisfaction,

137
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,300
a golden circle.

138
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,500
A golden circle.

139
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,100
A ring.

140
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,600
My ring.

141
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,800
l gave my ring to the Giant.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He is known to us here.

143
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Then he's real?

144
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,000
As real as l.

145
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,400
He can help you find Bob.

146
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,500
- How?
- You must ask him first.

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
How do l do that?

148
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Oh, you have all the clues you need.

149
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,700
The answer is not here my friend.

150
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,800
The answer is here.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
l don't understand.

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,600
So much responsibility.

153
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,800
l know about you.

154
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
That milk will cool down on you

155
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,000
but it's getting warmer now.

156
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,300
''Getting warmer now.''

157
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,700
Box and tag everything
in these drawers. Everything.

158
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,100
Coop, we found his telephone records.
Look at this.

159
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,600
The night Laura died.
Telephone call Leland told us about.

160
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Ben called her number
from this office.

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
White fox.

162
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah, white, dead and stuffed.
Maddy was here.

163
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,500
l think Ben killed her in this office,
then took her to the waterfall.

164
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,000
He killed Laura
and he killed Maddy.

165
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Madeleine Ferguson died
the night before last

166
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,100
between 1 0 p.m. and midnight.

167
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
That fits. We didn't take Ben in
until after midnight.

168
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,100
That's as close as l can cut it.

169
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,500
Ben Horne's blood test.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,900
A couple of minutes,
l'll have this up to code.

171
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,100
Tweaking the sensors, mostly.

172
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,500
Don't want your sprinklers
to be overly jumpy.

173
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,400
Gotta set it just so.

174
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,200
l wanna talk about my child,
our baby.

175
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,800
- Maybe.
- Maybe what?

176
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,600
Maybe it is our baby
and maybe it isn't.

177
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,200
Dick?

178
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,700
Oh, my Lord, is he the father?

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,600
At first l thought
you were the father.

180
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,400
But then you said
you didn't have any sperms.

181
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,700
Then l thought it was Dick
but now you say your sperms are back.

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
So as far as l can tell,
it's a 50-50 proposition.

183
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Andy, where are you going?

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
What are you doing?

185
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Who are you calling?

186
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,100
l want to speak to Richard Tremayne,
Men's Fashions.

187
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes, l'll hold.

188
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,100
You won't hurt him, will you, Andy?

189
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,200
Tremayne, Brennan.
Andy Brennan.

190
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,900
We need to talk.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
That is, if you're not too busy.

192
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,900
Tojamura-san.

193
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
How nice of you to come calling.

194
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
You are in prison.

195
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Yes, well,

196
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,300
a momentary inconvenience,
l assure you.

197
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,800
We have papers to sign.

198
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,100
The Ghostwood contracts.

199
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Tojamura-san,

200
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,800
l'm afraid there has been a snag.

201
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
A snag?

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Unforeseen difficulties.
Some legal in nature, others...

203
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,400
l'm unable to sign
the Ghostwood agreement at this time.

204
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,500
Then you will return
my five million dollars.

205
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,100
Well, l want to return your money.

206
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,200
l want to sign the contracts.

207
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
Tojamura-san,

208
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
as you can see,

209
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,300
l am incarcerated.

210
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,700
Falsely accused,

211
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,000
but my brother, the boy genius,

212
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,000
is out looking for a better lawyer.

213
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,000
And until justice is done,

214
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,700
until l am able to breathe the air
that free men breathe,

215
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,300
l plead with you for understanding.

216
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,100
This is the long, dark night
of my soul.

217
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,100
Time to seek that...

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,500
...tiny flickering flame within.

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Forgive me,
l've been very emotional lately.

220
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,600
Catherine?

221
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,300
Benjamin Horne.

222
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,800
You're a slimy rat bastard.

223
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,600
And l intend to make whatever
remains of your pathetic existence

224
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
a living hell.

225
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,200
Oh, Catherine.

226
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
You've come.

228
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,500
Oh, Catherine.

229
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Catherine, Catherine,
tell Sheriff Truman

230
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,100
about the night
that we spent together

231
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,200
the night that Laura was killed.

232
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,900
You want me to beg?

233
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,000
You want me to beg?
Because l'll beg.

234
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,100
Will you sign Ghostwood
and the mill over to me?

235
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,800
ln a heartbeat.

236
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,900
Clever disguise, Catherine.

237
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,900
Really brilliant.

238
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,700
Signed, sealed

239
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,800
and delivered.

240
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,600
Now, you'll tell the sheriff, huh?

241
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,600
You'll tell the sheriff.

242
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,000
l'll consider it.

243
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,800
Catherine. Catherine, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

244
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,000
lt's the truth, after all.

245
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Why, Ben, we've spent our entire
adult lives lying to each other.

246
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,500
Why spoil it with the truth now?

247
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,500
Catherine.

248
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,000
Catherine.

249
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Catherine!

250
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Donna,

251
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
l'm so happy you stopped by.

252
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
We haven't had the time
to just sit down and talk for so long.

253
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,800
May l get you a glass of lemonade?

254
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,500
No, thanks, Mr. Palmer.
l only have a minute.

255
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,500
This is for Maddy. lt's a tape
of a song we did with James.

256
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
l want her to have a copy.

257
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
That's very sweet of you.

258
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
She told me all about this.

259
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
She said it was
a very enjoyable experience.

260
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,000
Anyway, if you could mail it to her,
l'd really appreciate it.

261
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
No, it won't be any problem at all.

262
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,300
ls something wrong?

263
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,100
No.

264
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Those glasses.

265
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They were Laura's.
Maddy gave them to me.

266
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
l thought they looked familiar.

267
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
Mr. Palmer,

268
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,900
did you know
that they found Laura's secret diary?

269
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,300
Diary? Yes,
they took it from her room.

270
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
No, not the one the police found.

271
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,300
She had another one.

272
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,000
l didn't even know about it,
did you?

273
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
No.

274
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,900
She gave it to a man
named Harold Smith.

275
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,400
Harold killed himself a few days ago.

276
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,500
The police found it in his apartment.

277
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,400
Oh, my God.

278
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,200
l had no idea.

279
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
l wish l knew what was in it,
don't you?

280
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,800
l think about Laura all the time.

281
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, excuse me.

282
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Hello?

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, Beth, how are you?

284
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,000
No, not since yesterday.

285
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,500
Of course, Beth. l took Maddy
to the bus station myself.

286
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
Well, l--

287
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,900
l'm sure there must be some
perfectly reasonable explanation.

288
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
Yes, of course.
l'll call you immediately,

289
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
within the hour.

290
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,700
Bye, Beth.

291
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,000
Maddy?

292
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
lt's the strangest thing.

293
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
She never made it home.

294
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, God.

295
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,300
Donna, don't you worry
about a thing.

296
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,500
l'll get us some lemonade

297
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,000
and we'll sit down
and give it a think

298
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,900
and we'll work the problem out.

299
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,200
Together.

300
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,100
l knew she was expecting us,
l mean--

301
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,700
l guess l was selfish.
l thought l could see her anytime.

302
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Missoula's not that far away, right?

303
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,600
Donna, you're taking this much
too much to heart.

304
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
l'm sure she's just fine.

305
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,200
l know the cure for what ails you.

306
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,600
lt's simple, really.

307
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,200
lt always makes me feel good.

308
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,900
May we have this dance...

309
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
...please?

310
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,300
You stay right there.

311
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
Harry?

312
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,400
Leland, we need your help.

313
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,100
What is it?

314
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
- There's been another murder.
- Oh, my God.

315
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,900
l can't tell you why or how but we need
your help and we need it right away.

316
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,000
All right, anything, certainly.
Let me get my coat.

317
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Maddy.

318
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Maddy.

319
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,500
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

320
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
- lt's Maddy.
- What about her?

321
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,800
She's dead.

322
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,900
lt was the same killer.
The same one who killed Laura.

323
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,800
l heard Mr. Palmer get a phone call
from her mother.

324
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,900
She said
she hadn't gotten home yet.

325
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
Then they came over to talk to him,
Sheriff Truman.

326
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
- We could've helped her.
- How?

327
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,300
- We could've helped her.
- How?

328
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,100
l don't know.

329
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
- This is no good.
- What do you mean?

330
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
You mean us?

331
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,600
- l gotta go.
- James, it's not our fault, don't leave.

332
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,500
lt doesn't matter, don't you see?

333
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,800
Nothing we do matters.
Nothing's ever gonna change.

334
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,600
lt doesn't matter if we're happy
and the rest of the world goes to hell.

335
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,800
James, don't leave.

336
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,200
James, don't leave me!

337
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
Harry.

338
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,600
Leland.

339
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,300
Why are we here, Agent Cooper?

340
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,700
ls someone meeting us?

341
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,400
Yes.

342
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,200
ls it the killer?

343
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,000
l don't know. Maybe.

344
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,600
Ed, glad you're here.

345
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,400
l need everyone's help
to clear the room.

346
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,400
l need a large space in the center.

347
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,300
Of course.

348
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.

349
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,300
Bobby, why don't you wheel Leo
back over there.

350
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,200
Stay very, very quiet, you read me?

351
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.

352
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Gentlemen, two days ago
a young woman was found murdered

353
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,400
by the same individual,
l believe, responsible

354
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,800
for the death of Laura Palmer.

355
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,900
l have reason to believe
that the killer is in this room.

356
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,300
As a member of the Bureau,
l spend most of my time

357
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,500
seeking simple answers
to difficult questions.

358
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,300
ln the pursuit of Laura's killer,
l have employed Bureau guidelines,

359
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,600
deductive technique,
Tibetan method, instinct and luck.

360
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,400
But now l find myself
in need of something new,

361
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,700
which for lack of a better word
we shall call ''magic.''

362
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,100
Would you like us to hum?

363
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,500
A Tibetan chant, perhaps.

364
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,600
l think it's going terrifically well,
don't you?

365
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,700
Now what?

366
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,100
Harry, l'm not completely sure.

367
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,000
Someone is missing.

368
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
Excuse us.

369
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,800
Major Briggs, right on time.

370
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
l was on my way home.

371
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,900
This kind gentleman
flagged me down,

372
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,800
asked if l could drive him here.

373
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,800
l know that gum.
l used to chew it when l was a kid.

374
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,800
That's my most favorite gum
in the world.

375
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That gum you like
is going to come back in style.

376
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,700
My father

377
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,400
killed me.

378
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,900
Ben Horne,

379
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,500
l would like you to accompany me
to the sheriff's station.

380
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,400
You might like to bring along
Leland Palmer as your attorney.

381
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,400
Let's take him down to interrogation.

382
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Agent Cooper,
is he going to be charged?

383
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,600
Yes.

384
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,700
Then l think l'd like to begin bail
proceedings as soon as possible.

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
He'll have his day in court.

386
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Harry.

387
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
Everything will be all right, Ben.

388
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
Hawk, take Ben upstairs
and release him.

389
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,500
- Leland?
- That's not Leland.

390
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
How did you know?

391
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,500
Laura told me in her dream.

392
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,900
We're gonna need
a lot stronger evidence than this.

393
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
How about a confession, Harry?

394
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,300
You have the right to an attorney.

395
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,300
lf you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

396
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,700
Oh, yeah. l suppose you wanna
ask him some questions, huh?

397
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,900
Did you kill Laura Palmer?

398
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,500
That's a yes.

399
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,900
How about Madeleine Ferguson?

400
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
- What do you think?
- l'm asking you.

401
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,900
- What do you think?
- Answer the question.

402
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Oh, gosh, gee, gee whiz.
l guess l kind of sort of did.

403
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,400
l have this thing for knives.

404
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,400
Just like what happened to you
in Pittsburgh that time.

405
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,400
Huh, Cooper?

406
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,100
Oh, Leland.

407
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,500
Leland, Leland.

408
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
You've been a good vehicle

409
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,000
and l've enjoyed the ride.

410
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,400
But now he's weak and full of holes.

411
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,500
lt's almost nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.

412
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,600
Does Leland know
what you've done?

413
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
Leland's a babe in the woods

414
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,500
with a large hole
where his conscience used to be.

415
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,500
And when l go, children,
l will pull that ripcord

416
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,300
and you watch Leland, remember.
Watch him.

417
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
But not for long.

418
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
That's enough for me.

419
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,900
Dick,

420
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,500
could you come with me, please?

421
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,600
Okay, here's how
this is going to work.

422
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,200
l'm going to keep my baby.

423
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,400
That's not open for discussion.

424
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,300
- l see.
- Be quiet, let her talk.

425
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,400
Got a light?

426
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,900
No.

427
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
You were saying.

428
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,300
There's only one way to handle this.

429
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,200
They have a test to determine
the blood type of the father.

430
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,300
lt could be you

431
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,200
or it could be you.

432
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,700
They won't be doing this test
until after the baby is born,

433
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,700
during which time
l expect complete cooperation

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,400
from each of you two gentlemen.

435
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,700
Whatever you say, Lucy.

436
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,900
l mean, it is your baby.

437
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,000
Thank you.

438
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
Ben Horne's blood test,
he's the wrong type.

439
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,500
Harry, the answer was right in front
of me from the very beginning.

440
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,500
What did the little man do
in my dream?

441
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
He danced.

442
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,800
After Laura's death,
Leland danced compulsively.

443
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,000
We were told that Bob the killer
was a gray-haired man.

444
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
When Leland killed Jacques,
his hair turned gray overnight.

445
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Leland said when he was a child

446
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
the gray-haired man next door
was named Robertson.

447
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,400
Mike said the people Bob inhabited
were his children.

448
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,300
Robertson, son of Robert.

449
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,900
The letters under the finger nails:
R, O, B, T.

450
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,500
Bob was spelling his name.

451
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,800
A signature on a demon self-portrait.

452
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,900
Why would he kill her?

453
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,800
Laura was writing about Bob
in her diary.

454
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,100
Leland found it, ripped out the pages.
She knew he was on to her.

455
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,900
lt was Leland who placed that call
from Ben Horne's office

456
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,600
to Laura the night she died.

457
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,000
He was the third man
outside Jacques' cabin.

458
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,200
He took the girls to the train car. lt was
his blood we found not Ben Horne's.

459
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,100
- Then why kill Maddy?
- Maybe she reminded him of Laura.

460
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,800
Maddy was going home.
He couldn't bear to part with her.

461
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
He wanted to relive the experience

462
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,900
or maybe she realized
Bob was the killer and he found out.

463
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,400
Now, this Bob.

464
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,400
He can't really exist.
l mean, Leland is just crazy, right?

465
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Through the dark of futures past,

466
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,300
the magician longs to see

467
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,800
One chants out between two worlds

468
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,500
Fire walk with me

469
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,900
l'll catch you with my death bag.

470
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,800
You may think l've gone insane

471
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,800
but l promise l will kill again!

472
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,400
Harry, hurry.

473
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
The key.

474
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Leland.

475
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,600
Leland.

476
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,400
Harry. Leland.

477
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Call an ambulance.

478
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Oh, God, Laura.

479
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
l killed her.

480
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,700
Oh, my God. l killed my daughter.

481
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,700
l didn't know.

482
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,700
Laura, forgive me.

483
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,000
Forgive me.

484
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,700
- Oh, God.
- lt's okay.

485
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,000
lt's all right.

486
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,200
l was just a boy.

487
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,200
l saw him in my dreams.

488
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,300
He said he wanted to play.

489
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,400
He opened me and l invited him
and he came inside me.

490
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,000
He went inside?

491
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,400
When he was inside, l didn't know.

492
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,700
And when he was gone,
l couldn't remember.

493
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,300
He made me do things...

494
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,000
...terrible things.

495
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,800
He said he wanted lives,

496
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,500
he wanted others.

497
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,500
Others that they could use
like they used me.

498
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Like Laura?

499
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,500
They wanted her.

500
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,800
They wanted Laura,
but she was strong.

501
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,800
She fought them.

502
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,200
She wouldn't let them in.

503
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Oh, God.

504
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,500
They had me kill that girl, Theresa.

505
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
And they-- They said...

506
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,900
...if l didn't give them Laura,

507
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,000
they'd have me kill her too.

508
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,200
But she wouldn't let them in?

509
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,900
She said she'd die
before she let them.

510
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,200
And they made me kill her.

511
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,100
Oh, God, have mercy on me.

512
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
What have l done?

513
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,700
What have l done?

514
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,800
Oh, God, l love her.

515
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,600
l loved her with all my heart.

516
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,700
My angel, forgive me.

517
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,100
Leland.

518
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,800
Leland, the time has come
for you to seek the path.

519
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,800
Your soul has set you
face to face with a clear light

520
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,300
and you are now about to experience it
in its reality,

521
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,000
wherein all things are like the void
and cloudless sky

522
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,300
and the naked, spotless intellect
is like a transparent vacuum

523
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,500
without circumference or center.

524
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,900
Leland, in this moment,
know yourself

525
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,600
and abide in that state.

526
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,000
Look to the light, Leland.

527
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Find the light.

528
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,200
l see it.

529
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,300
lnto the light, Leland.
lnto the light.

530
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,100
l see her.

531
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,700
She's there.

532
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,300
lnto the light, Leland.

533
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,300
She's beautiful.

534
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,700
lnto the light.

535
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,800
Laura.

536
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Don't be afraid.

537
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,300
He was completely insane.

538
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,900
Think so?

539
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,900
But people saw Bob.

540
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,000
People saw him in visions:
Laura, Maddy, Sarah Palmer.

541
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,000
Gentlemen,
there's more in heaven and earth...

542
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,400
...than is dreamt up in our philosophy.

543
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,200
Amen.

544
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,400
Well, l've lived in these old woods
most of my life.

545
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,700
l've seen some strange things
but this is way off the map.

546
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,300
l'm having a hard time believing.

547
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,400
Harry, is it easier to believe

548
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,300
a man would rape and murder
his own daughter?

549
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Any more comforting?

550
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,900
No.

551
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,900
An evil that great
in this beautiful world...

552
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
...finally,
does it matter what the cause?

553
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,700
Yes, because it's our job to stop it.

554
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,500
Yeah.

555
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,700
Maybe that's all Bob is.

556
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,100
The evil that men do.

557
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,400
Maybe it doesn't matter
what we call it.

558
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
Maybe not.

559
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,500
But if he was real, if he was here,

560
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,400
and we had him trapped

561
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
and he got away,

562
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
where's Bob now?



0
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
