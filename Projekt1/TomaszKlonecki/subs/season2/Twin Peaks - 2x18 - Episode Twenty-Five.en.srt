1
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,358
Do you like that?

2
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,659
Oh, Harry.

3
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,595
Josie.

4
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,893
Yes.

5
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,063
Yes, it's me.

6
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:23,402
l'm here.

7
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,946
- Josie.
- Harry, l'm here.

8
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,014
Josie...

9
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:45,916
Room service.

10
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,686
Come on in, it's open.

11
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,998
You can just put it on the table.

12
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,128
Audrey.

13
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,804
l trust your sleep was untroubled?

14
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,031
Here at The Great Northern,
we aim to make your stay

15
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:04,665
as comfortable
and as enjoyable as possible.

16
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:08,837
You know, we take the concept
of room service very seriously.

17
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:13,917
Do you remember
your grandfather?

18
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,180
Colorful man,
one of the wisest l ever met.

19
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,116
You know what he once said?

20
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,284
He said if you're gonna bring
a hammer, you better bring nails.

21
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,293
What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,626
What that means is the next time
you come into my room

23
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,666
and carry on,
you'd better be ready to finish

24
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,326
whatever it is
you came here to start.

25
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:36,437
- Maybe l'm ready now.
- Then be yourself.

26
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:40,176
l am being myself.

27
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:43,176
You're right.

28
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:44,975
You're absolutely right.

29
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,710
l stand corrected, you're a beautiful,
intelligent young woman.

30
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:50,980
What else?

31
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:57,592
You have an undeniable
magic about you...

32
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:01,265
...that inspires a plan.

33
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,963
Flight at sunset and dinner for two?

34
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,395
- When?
- What, the flight or the sunset?

35
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:11,373
Well, l have to go to the library and
have a meeting with my father later.

36
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,341
A simple yes or no would do.

37
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,372
Yes.

38
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,486
And if you bring a hammer,
you better bring some nails too.

39
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,406
Anything?

40
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,407
No, not a word. She wants to speak
to the South African consulate.

41
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,875
ln Twin Peaks?

42
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,581
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?

43
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,645
Sexual jealousy.

44
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,879
Oh, yeah.

45
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,579
lt's good to have you back, Harry.

46
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,055
Taken me a day
or so to get my sea legs.

47
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,717
Well, to be honest, it looks like
you went down with the ship.

48
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,386
Why don't you go home
and recuperate?

49
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:08,227
No, all l need is some coffee,
maybe a little food.

50
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,562
Sure-fire cure for a hangover, Harry.

51
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,331
You take a glass of nearly frozen,
unstrained tomato juice.

52
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,838
You plop a couple of oysters in there,
you drink it down.

53
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,066
Breathe deeply.

54
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,609
Next, you take a mound,
and l mean a mound, of sweetbreads,

55
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,974
saute them with some chestnuts
and some Canadian bacon.

56
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:23,672
Finally, biscuits.

57
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,784
Big biscuits, smothered in gravy.

58
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,682
Now, here's where it gets tricky,
you're gonna need some anchovies--

59
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,982
Excuse me.

60
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,426
That should do it.

61
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,867
The bonsai. The ultimate miniature.

62
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,368
Bicarbonate of soda,
the ultimate digestive aid.

63
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,970
Harry, quaff in good health.

64
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,643
Thank you.

65
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:03,114
Where the hell did that come from?

66
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,688
lt was delivered this morning.

67
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,231
lt's from Josie.

68
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:19,669
Harry, Windom Earle
was at my house.

69
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,372
Windom Earle. When?

70
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:29,208
Yesterday. He left this with Donna.

71
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,342
He's closing in, Harry.

72
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,914
Knight to king bishop 3.
What do we do?

73
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,023
We publish our next move today.

74
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:41,160
Thanks, Lucy.

75
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:42,726
Brace yourself, Harry.

76
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,421
- Agent Dale Cooper.
- Gordon Cole.

77
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,497
Sure sorry to interrupt you fellas.

78
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,101
But, Coop, l'm bringing you
the classified portion

79
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,068
of the Windom Earle dossier.

80
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,501
Back from Bend?

81
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,073
Been on over to Bend, Oregon.

82
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,733
Whole lot of shaking
going on down in Bend.

83
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,538
Enter Gordon Cole.

84
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,919
This is so galling, Leo.

85
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,287
Young Dale is continually refusing
to play fair!

86
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,591
When Earle went:

87
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,755
the doctors discovered
he was on haloperidol.

88
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,527
The same drug the one-armed man,
Gerard, was on.

89
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,932
- What's that?
- Gerard used the same drug.

90
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,129
You got it.

91
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,707
But they figured he was using
the drug to fake his illness

92
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,468
just as you suspected, Coop.

93
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,976
Definite schizoid maneuvering.

94
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,649
''Project Blue Book?''

95
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,652
My God, Gordon,
what was he doing on this?

96
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:47,657
The Bureau loaned Earle out
to the Air Force in 1 965.

97
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:51,228
Reports on his two-year hitch
are blacked out. National security.

98
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:52,421
Wait a minute.

99
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,623
Earle was investigating UFOs?

100
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,830
Major Briggs, Harry.

101
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,836
Gordon, there are some
curious linkages here.

102
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:03,100
The word linkage
reminds me of sausage.

103
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,642
Never cared much for the links,
preferred the patties.

104
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:10,180
But breakfast is a real good idea.

105
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,408
Bonsai.

106
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:14,075
Remember those
old World War ll movies?

107
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,743
Bonsai!

108
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,757
Damnation!

109
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,957
Good to see you again, doc.
Sheriff, we'll be riding with you.

110
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,259
Cruiser's right outside.

111
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,026
Hold it one second there, Coop.

112
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:32,363
You'd better dust off
your own black suit.

113
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,597
With Windom Earle
rolling around loose on the deck,

114
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:36,503
we need you back on the team.

115
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:38,166
What are you saying, Gordon?

116
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,835
Coop, it gives me great pleasure
to reinstate you

117
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:44,609
into the Federal Bureau
of lnvestigation.

118
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,655
Brand-new issue,
more accurate and efficient.

119
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:51,847
Smith & Wesson, ten millimeter.

120
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,961
Model 1 076, all stainless steel.

121
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,621
lt's a beautiful weapon, Coop,
and it's all yours.

122
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,164
Thank you, Gordon.

123
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:05,134
Cooper, we're gonna find Earle.
We will pursue,

124
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:08,637
- capture and incarcerate.
- Capture and incarcerate.

125
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,208
Let's hit the road.

126
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,844
Come on, buster, l'm buying.

127
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,347
On your tail, Gordon.

128
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:22,579
Now, Leo...

129
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:27,419
...pick three cards.

130
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,863
One,

131
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,563
two,

132
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,535
three.

133
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,939
Queen Donna.

134
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:50,846
Queen Audrey.

135
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,444
Queen Shelly, good.

136
00:12:55,922 --> 00:13:00,120
Now, see if you can find the king.

137
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,526
Little Dale.

138
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,831
Now, we need one more queen.

139
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,371
Let's see.

140
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,944
The queen of hearts.

141
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:23,039
Let me see.

142
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,380
Miss Twin Peaks.

143
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,946
Now, what do you get if you win?
You get a dozen roses,

144
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,251
a scholarship to the college
of your choice,

145
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,055
the accolades of your peers...

146
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,891
Oh, yes, l know.

147
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:41,993
You get to die.

148
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,432
A royal execution.

149
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,604
And Cooper...

150
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:58,149
...gets to watch.

151
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,359
Hello, Ben.

152
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,668
l need to talk to you.

153
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:09,980
How was everything, sir?

154
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,154
Unbelievable.

155
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:21,531
- ls Audrey Horne here?
- She's in the back. l'll get her for you.

156
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:22,826
Thanks.

157
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,531
Donna, hi.

158
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,505
Hi, Donna.

159
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,905
Hi.

160
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,374
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

161
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,743
- Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

162
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,745
This might sound a little strange.

163
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,180
What?

164
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:48,391
Would you know any reason
why my mom's visiting your dad?

165
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:50,559
Not offhand.

166
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:56,633
Okay, well, yesterday,
he came by the house to see my mom.

167
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,929
And today,
she drove over here to see him.

168
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,932
Maybe she's just helping him
with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.

169
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,509
No, she would have said something
to me, and she hasn't said a word.

170
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,878
ls she here now?

171
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,209
They're in his office together.

172
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,414
No, l won't accept them.

173
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,059
They're your letters.

174
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,060
They were written to you.

175
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,560
l don't want them.

176
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,790
l won't have them
in my house any longer.

177
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,561
You've had them for 20 years.

178
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,397
Why now?

179
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,472
That's just what l'm asking you.
Why now?

180
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,974
They'll only succeed
in ripping apart old wounds.

181
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,636
l can't bear the thought of it.

182
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,149
Eileen.

183
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:50,346
Eileen, why don't you believe me?

184
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:51,580
Words aren't good enough.

185
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,920
l want my actions to speak for me.
Haven't you been listening?

186
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,028
l have been wrong all these years.

187
00:16:57,196 --> 00:17:00,859
l am trying to make up for it.

188
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:04,668
Sometimes, making up for things
only makes it worse.

189
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:07,305
Oh, Eileen.

190
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,005
You should have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

191
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,808
Ben, please.

192
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:21,711
l haven't held you since that night.

193
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,684
Don't.

194
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,517
Oh, l wanna hold you.

195
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,154
l wanna go back.

196
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,522
- God, if you'd just--
- Please, don't!

197
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,164
l'm sorry.

198
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,171
- Have you told her?
- God, no.

199
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:53,648
Never. l never will.
And you must promise me the same.

200
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,811
You mustn't come over again.

201
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,352
You must stay away from her.

202
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:04,522
l understand.

203
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,858
l hope you do.

204
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,271
What the hell was that all about?

205
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:21,071
l don't know.

206
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,384
But l'm gonna find out.

207
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,587
Harry, the best cure l ever came
across for a hangover

208
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:34,385
was raw meat, and plenty of it.

209
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,891
You break an egg on it.

210
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:41,958
Add in some salted anchovies,
Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.

211
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:45,103
lf you want,
we can order up some for you.

212
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:50,806
Now that l come to mention it, Coop,
you know what l'm in the mood for?

213
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,034
What's that, Gordon?

214
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,111
A steak so rare,
you could sell it at Tiffany's.

215
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,942
Well, you've come to the right place.

216
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,551
Good deal.

217
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,786
Holy smokes, who is that?

218
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,117
Shelly Johnson.

219
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,291
Shelly Johnson.

220
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,792
What a beauty.

221
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:20,302
Kind of reminds me of that statue,
the babe without the arms.

222
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,835
- Venus de Milo.
- The name was Milo,

223
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:25,169
but that's beside the point.

224
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,711
That's the kind of girl to make you wish
you spoke a little French.

225
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:35,985
Excuse me, Coop, while l try my hand
at a little counter Esperanto.

226
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,248
Good luck, Gordon.

227
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,323
Hello.

228
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:46,589
l was wondering if l might trouble you
for a cup of strong, black coffee.

229
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:48,157
And in the process,

230
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:52,464
engage you with an anecdote
of no small amusement.

231
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,540
The name is Gordon Cole,

232
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,969
and l couldn't help
but notice you from the booth.

233
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,977
And...well, seeing your beauty now,

234
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:06,516
l feel as though my stomach is filled
with a team of bumblebees.

235
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,977
You don't have to shout,
l can hear you.

236
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,847
l heard that.

237
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,685
l heard that.

238
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,327
Do you want anything
besides coffee?

239
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,258
l heard you perfectly.

240
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:20,295
And l can hear you, honest, please--

241
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,832
You don't understand.

242
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,493
You don't understand, Miss Johnson.
Do you see these?

243
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,002
For 20 years, l've been
asking people to please speak up,

244
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:33,667
but for some weird reason,
l can hear you clear as a bell.

245
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:35,279
Say something else.

246
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,310
Do you want pie with your coffee?

247
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,520
Good Lord. l can hear you perfectly.

248
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:46,556
This is like some kind of miracle.
A phenomenon.

249
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,919
- What's wrong with miracles?
- What's that?

250
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,794
This cherry pie is a miracle.

251
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:59,429
Would you please ask the lady
with the log to speak up?

252
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:03,441
The pie, she was talking
about the cherry pie.

253
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,736
l heard you again. l heard you again.

254
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:09,574
Would you like some pie?

255
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:12,076
Massive, massive quantities.

256
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:15,687
And a glass of water, sweetheart,
my socks are on fire.

257
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,340
Harry.

258
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:44,282
That looks like a chickadee
on a Dodge Dart.

259
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,887
No, it looks like a finch
on a Dodge Dart.

260
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,784
Nope, chickadee on a Dodge Dart.

261
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,258
- Hi.
- Hi. Cup of deep black joe?

262
00:21:57,796 --> 00:21:58,854
You bet.

263
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,895
What do you recommend
for a hangover?

264
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,004
Teetotaling and prayer.

265
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:08,731
Good answer.

266
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:11,505
l'll try some coffee.

267
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,678
How are you today?

268
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,775
l'm fine.

269
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,144
l'm weird, actually.

270
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:20,951
l'm disoriented,

271
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,485
l'm not sure where l am.
l mean, l know where l am,

272
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,090
but it feels odd being here.

273
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,384
l'm okay.

274
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,851
Okay.

275
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,259
Listen to me, l've been out
of circulation so long,

276
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,932
l've completely forgotten
the social niceties.

277
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,260
l mean, you ask me how l am,

278
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:37,993
l'm not really supposed
to say how l am.

279
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,105
l'm supposed to say,
''l'm fine, thanks. How are you?''

280
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,438
l'm fine, thanks.

281
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:49,669
- You must think l'm really strange.
- No.

282
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:51,712
Well, with due respect
to the social niceties,

283
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:55,182
even if you did think l was strange,
you wouldn't tell me, would you?

284
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,685
No, if l thought you were strange,
l'd tell you.

285
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,982
And you don't think so?

286
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,854
Not a bit.

287
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:05,327
Good. Glad we got that cleared up.

288
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,057
So, what will you have?

289
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:12,693
l would like a chicken potpie
and a large glass of milk, please.

290
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,372
Good choice.
All the major food groups represented.

291
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:20,240
Turkey sandwich, whole wheat,
lettuce, dollop of mayonnaise,

292
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:21,708
and l've got a joke for you.

293
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,744
Two penguins were walking
across an iceberg.

294
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,547
One penguin turned
to the second penguin and said:

295
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,654
''You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo.''

296
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:30,880
Annie?

297
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:33,053
l heard that.

298
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,817
Wait a minute, l'll be right back.

299
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,457
l wasn't quite finished.

300
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,397
How long you been
in love with her?

301
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,866
Harry, who said anything
about love?

302
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:50,505
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.

303
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,874
l did?

304
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:59,077
So, what did
the second penguin say?

305
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,877
Well, the first penguin said
to the second penguin:

306
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,919
''You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo.''

307
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,889
And the second penguin said,
''Maybe l am.''

308
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:14,024
The defense rests.

309
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,061
Do you want some more pie?
A whole pie?

310
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,932
Yes, l would, Miss Johnson,
and a piece of paper and a pencil.

311
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,701
l plan on writing an epic poem
about this gorgeous pie.

312
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,207
Okay.

313
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,910
l see that you've been to Owl Cave.

314
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,146
Sorry?

315
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:41,383
Well, that design looks like
the one up at Owl Cave.

316
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,158
Let me see that.

317
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,763
l combined Major Briggs' tattoo
with the Log Lady's.

318
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,627
This looks exactly
like the one at Owl Cave.

319
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:56,029
Harry, l've got to see this Owl Cave.

320
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:16,753
Dear Donna,

321
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,689
You were right, l had to go.

322
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:23,130
Everything feels different
when you're on the road.

323
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:25,493
lt feels better.

324
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,997
San Francisco's really cool.

325
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,471
Next stop, Mexico.

326
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:32,837
l'll be back with a million stories.

327
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,672
l promise.

328
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,873
l love you, James.

329
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,986
James?

330
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,123
How is he?

331
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,961
He's good.

332
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,190
He's doing what he needed to do.

333
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:57,832
He'll be back.

334
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:04,306
Dad, can l ask you something?

335
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,869
Sure.

336
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,170
How does Mom know
Benjamin Horne?

337
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:12,339
l doubt that she does, Donna.
Not very well.

338
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:14,342
He was over here yesterday.

339
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,646
They were talking like old friends.

340
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:19,016
Your mother works a lot
with the local charities.

341
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:22,422
l'm sure even Ben contributes
once in a while.

342
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:26,427
She drove to The Great Northern
this morning to see him again.

343
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,593
Probably something to do
with a fundraiser.

344
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:30,826
l don't think so.

345
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:35,199
Yeah, that's exactly what it was,
she told me at breakfast.

346
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,842
One of those heal-the-planet things.

347
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,676
Well, she didn't mention it to me.

348
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,671
Well, that's exactly what it was,
that's what she told me.

349
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,785
l'll get it.

350
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:57,051
Hi, l have a delivery
for Mrs. Hayward.

351
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,731
They said they're for Mom.

352
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,930
No card.

353
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,737
l'll put them in water.

354
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,064
Sorry, sorry, my fault.

355
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,331
- l didn't hear you.
- No.

356
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:43,497
One should never allow
one's mind and one's foot

357
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:46,143
to wander at the same time.

358
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,907
Edward Perkins.
Once again, my apologies.

359
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,249
Audrey Horne.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Perkins.

360
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:55,510
So, what brings you to the library?

361
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,154
l'm doing research
on civil disobedience.

362
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,588
Good for you. lt is incumbent
on the young to disobey.

363
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:03,587
Are you a professor?

364
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:07,788
Well, l teach,
poetry is my area of expertise.

365
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:11,367
You're kidding. You know, someone
sent me a poem, maybe you know it.

366
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,333
Oh, perhaps l do.
Now, let's have a look.

367
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,634
You read it.

368
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:22,671
Okay.

369
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:26,147
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another,

370
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:30,186
No sister-flower would be forgiven
lf it disdain'd its brother,

371
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:33,882
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea

372
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:41,022
What is all this sweet work worth,
lf thou kiss not me?

373
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,530
Yeah, you know it.

374
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:45,334
Yes. Shelley.

375
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,563
What?

376
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,901
Gazing at you

377
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,874
reciting the verse of Shelley,

378
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:57,504
you look very much like a queen.

379
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,345
Thank you.

380
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:05,917
l guess l better be going.
Nice meeting you.

381
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:08,285
- Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
- Yeah.

382
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,411
- Thinking of entering?
- No.

383
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,209
l think the real world's strange enough
without getting on-stage

384
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:34,784
and parading around
in a bathing suit and heels.

385
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,319
Guess the convent's not too big
on that kind of stuff.

386
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,255
That's a good guess.

387
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:42,889
So, what's it like being back
in civilization?

388
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,093
lt's not like they kept us
up in an attic.

389
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:49,700
l mean, we had newspapers,
we even had cable TV.

390
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:53,529
Every time l tell someone where l've
been, they act like l'm out on parole.

391
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:56,396
Sorry.

392
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,135
You know what is weird?
Being around men again.

393
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:05,145
Well, you don't have to spend time
in a convent to feel that.

394
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,579
What do you know
about Dale Cooper?

395
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,619
Are we interested?

396
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:11,982
Who said anything about that?

397
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:14,819
Well, judging by the look on his face
when he saw you today,

398
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:17,154
l'd say you have a major opportunity.

399
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:19,262
Sorry, you have it all wrong.

400
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,059
l'm not even remotely interested.

401
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,117
Andy?

402
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:51,257
Yes, Lucy.

403
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:56,366
l wanna thank you for helping out
during the weasel riot yesterday.

404
00:30:56,535 --> 00:31:00,164
Which is more than l can say
for a certain Dick we both know.

405
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:04,039
Keeping the peace is part of my job.

406
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:07,975
Where are you going
with all of that gear?

407
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,145
Spelunking.

408
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:14,144
ls it dangerous? Spelunking?

409
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,282
Sometimes.

410
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,451
Promise me something?

411
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,717
Okay.

412
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,520
l know you'll be strong,

413
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:28,660
and l know you'll be brave,

414
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:32,997
but l want you to promise me
that you'll be careful.

415
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:38,133
l'll be careful. You have my word.

416
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:50,217
Oh...dear.

417
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:59,561
- All set, Harry?
- Pete just called in our next move.

418
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:03,330
- We expose a pawn to his bishop.
- Want me to hold off?

419
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:04,900
No, Pete knows what he's doing.

420
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,901
lf he takes that pawn,
he forfeits the bishop.

421
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,097
Thus, losing his initial advantage.

422
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,332
How you feeling?

423
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,999
Like someone pounded
a railroad spike through my ear.

424
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:15,544
Then a descent into a cool,
subterranean cave

425
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,615
will be just what the doctor ordered.

426
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,410
Are you sure Cole's up
for the climb?

427
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,212
Gordon's not coming with us.

428
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,584
Shelly took him up to Doc Hayward's
to see about his hearing problem.

429
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:28,419
The old tuning-fork test.

430
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,075
Audrey?

431
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,578
When Jack Kennedy
entered the White House,

432
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,614
he took his brother with him.

433
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,981
Because he trusted Bobby
to tell him the truth,

434
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:58,588
even when it wasn't pretty.

435
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,288
When the Bay of Pigs went up
in smoke, Bobby was there.

436
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:07,727
When the Russians moved
their missiles into Fidel's backyard,

437
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:11,767
Bobby was there to help his brother
shoulder through.

438
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:14,965
Sort of how Jerry's done that
for you?

439
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,601
lt's the unvarnished truth
that l am looking for.

440
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,977
And l believe that you...

441
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:30,280
...are the best man for the job.

442
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,252
Me?

443
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:37,190
Audrey,

444
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:42,327
l know that l haven't been
a very good father.

445
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:48,266
Oh, heck, who am l kidding?

446
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,868
When have l ever been anything
but a sleazy, rapacious heel?

447
00:33:56,681 --> 00:33:58,444
Well, Daddy,
maybe when l was little, but--

448
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:02,313
Exactly. But l've changed.

449
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:05,979
And l am determined
to be a better person.

450
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:12,323
The kind of father
that you will respect someday.

451
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:19,963
When l think about Laura,

452
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:23,397
when l think about the mistakes
that l've made,

453
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:31,072
l want to build a life in happiness
for our whole family.

454
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,547
You, me.

455
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,184
Will you help me do that?

456
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:41,155
Please?

457
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:44,556
Daddy, l'm your man.

458
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,161
Sensational.

459
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,666
Audrey, pack a bag,
get out to the airport,

460
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:53,736
your plane leaves in an hour.

461
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,270
My plane?

462
00:34:57,275 --> 00:35:01,336
Oh, John. Just the man
that l wanna see.

463
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:03,241
Hi, Ben. Hello, Audrey.

464
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:07,882
- Daddy--
- Audrey, you better get a move on.

465
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,748
One hour. Audrey's on her way
to Seattle tonight.

466
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,755
She's having a breakfast confab
with the environmentalists.

467
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:18,055
We're going national
with this...pine-weasel thing.

468
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,457
Great, that's great.

469
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:22,259
Daddy, l'm not sure l can leave
on such short notice.

470
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,528
Now, here are the particulars.
Time, place, so on.

471
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,937
Audrey, you bring us back
good news.

472
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:33,041
Good news.

473
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,713
Well, guess l better go.

474
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

475
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:51,918
Travel safely, Audrey.

476
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,332
John.

477
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,006
How are you, Ben?

478
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:14,646
l am filled to the brim
with a feeling of goodness.

479
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:19,120
Like a Christmas tree
all lit up inside.

480
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:25,786
But at the end of the day
when l look in the mirror,

481
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:32,597
l have to face the fact
that l really don't know how to be good.

482
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,328
You're off to a pretty fair start.

483
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,600
How do you do it, John?
What's the secret?

484
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,609
Do you really think
that l could learn to be good?

485
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:44,873
l don't see why not.
Just keep your eye on your heart.

486
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,277
And always tell the truth.

487
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:51,652
- Always tell the truth.
- Tell the hardest truth first though.

488
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:56,350
Oh, always tell the hardest truth first.
Oh, l love that.

489
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,222
John, that's terrific.

490
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:03,231
This truth business, it's clearly
at the forefront of goodness.

491
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:04,459
Ben?

492
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:09,868
- l'm falling in love with your daughter.
- Yeah, that's a hard truth.

493
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,339
- Good example.
- lt is the truth.

494
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,779
- lt is?
- Yep.

495
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,684
Oh, John.

496
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,782
- John.
- Ben.

497
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:30,691
What a wonderful world we live in.

498
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,269
- Come on, Andy.
- Get a good grip, Andy.

499
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,569
- Do it.
- That's it, Andy.

500
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,440
- Looking good.
- Hand over hand.

501
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,613
Almost there. Take it easy.

502
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,910
- No, no, no. Don't look down. No.
- Hang on, Andy. Don't look down.

503
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:57,054
- Hang on.
- Don't look down!

504
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,086
- Andy.
- You okay?

505
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,228
l'm fine.

506
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,592
lncredible.

507
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:15,072
We used to play here
when l was a kid.

508
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,037
Pretend that it was haunted
by fierce ghosts.

509
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,143
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.

510
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,540
Where's the symbol?

511
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,981
This way.

512
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,452
lt's right here.

513
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:46,965
There it is.

514
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:57,840
Two symbols combined
into a larger whole.

515
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,449
But for what purpose?

516
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,309
l don't know.

517
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:02,843
Beats me.

518
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,149
The tattoos are the question.

519
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,087
This must be the answer.

520
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,193
lt's stuck.

521
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,233
My pick, it's stuck.

522
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,138
Oh, my God.

523
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,892
Holy smoke.

524
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,725
Look at that.

525
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,733
What have l done?

526
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:39,676
Fellas, coincidence and fate
figure largely in our lives.

527
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:53,121
lt appears to be a petroglyph.

528
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,729
Harry, l have no idea
where this will lead us.

529
00:40:57,902 --> 00:41:04,432
But l have a definite feeling it will be
a place both wonderful and strange.

530
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,404
Good evening.
Can l help you, young lady?

531
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:45,912
Yes, l would like something to drink,
but l'm not exactly sure what.

532
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:47,974
Ladies seem to like the rum.

533
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:50,613
Rum. l would like to have
a rum, please.

534
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:53,688
- With...?
- Tonic?

535
00:41:56,928 --> 00:42:01,956
Diane, Thursday, 9:05 p.m.

536
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:05,000
l've just returned from a place
called Owl Cave.

537
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,364
How l got there
is a rather complicated story.

538
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:10,666
lt all began with a pair of tattoos...

539
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:21,375
First one's on me.

540
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,018
Thank you.

541
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:24,814
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

542
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:27,719
- Can l get you something--?
- No, no. l have a rum and tonic.

543
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,052
l see.

544
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,058
One of the sisters
used to put rum in her tea,

545
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:33,459
and l thought it sounded exotic, so...

546
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,030
This is all new to you, isn't it?

547
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,634
l feel constantly amazed, stunned.

548
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:43,000
Music and people,

549
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,199
the way they talk and laugh,

550
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,310
and the way some of them
are so clearly in love.

551
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:49,643
lt's like a foreign language to me.

552
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,975
l know just enough of the words
to realize how little l understand.

553
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:56,151
Man, l would love to see the world
through your eyes.

554
00:42:56,888 --> 00:42:57,912
Why?

555
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,852
Oh, there's some things
l might do different if l had the chance.

556
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:04,017
Me too.

557
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:21,500
You see, the thing is,
l failed before and...

558
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,744
l'm just afraid it might happen again.

559
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:31,755
You wanna talk about it?

560
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:35,192
Not yet.

561
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:37,753
Maybe l can help.

562
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:40,790
Can you?

563
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,755
lf you want me to.

564
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:47,068
l'm stubborn. Extremely willful.

565
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:48,533
l can handle that.

566
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:51,772
Some people think l'm strange.

567
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,375
l know the feeling.

568
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,246
l couldn't promise you
that l would always make sense

569
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,476
or do things
that you would expect me to do.

570
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,414
Annie, l don't expect anything.

571
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,620
Then l accept your kind
and generous offer.

572
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:13,287
Good. l'm glad.

573
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:40,017
My, my, my.

574
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,023
What have we...

575
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:45,227
...here?

576
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:48,655
Could it be?

577
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:53,769
Yes.

578
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,170
The symbol inverted.

579
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,381
Now...
