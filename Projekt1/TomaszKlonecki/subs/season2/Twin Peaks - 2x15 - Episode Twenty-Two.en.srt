1
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,105
Would you know his full name?

2
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,800
l barely knew the kid.

3
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,707
Jim.

4
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:50,244
- Jim.
- James.

5
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,510
James Hurley.

6
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,613
He said he was from Twin Peaks.

7
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:58,120
He's a drifter.

8
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:03,422
He was probably long gone by the time
Mr. Marsh pulled out of the driveway.

9
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:05,360
Did he work here long?

10
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,262
Mrs. Marsh hired him
to fix the Jaguar.

11
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,834
Jaguar...

12
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:16,200
J-A-G-W-- A car.

13
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:17,741
How did you meet him, Mrs. Marsh?

14
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:21,880
Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down
near Wallies.

15
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,642
l went in to use the phone.

16
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,685
He offered to help.

17
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:31,381
Okay, we'll check that. Thank you.

18
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,629
And so we bid adieu
to James Hurley.

19
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,132
Give it a rest.

20
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:45,899
Careful, Evelyn.

21
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:49,405
l'm not sure l can tolerate
a nervous co-conspirator.

22
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:53,512
l just want it over with, all right?

23
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:57,215
Anything you say, Mrs. Marsh.

24
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:24,275
James, we can't get out of this
by ourselves.

25
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:26,378
We're gonna need someone
to help us.

26
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,776
l didn't do anything.

27
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,077
Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh.
l'm being framed.

28
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,049
Can l get you something,
Miss Hayward?

29
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,347
No. No, thank you.

30
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,052
Look, it doesn't make any difference.

31
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,063
We can't wait for the cops
to catch us.

32
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:50,464
- l think l should call Ed.
- No, no, don't.

33
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:53,470
l gotta-- My only chance
is to talk to Evelyn myself.

34
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,770
lf she told me that this was all a setup,
maybe she'll just tell the police that too.

35
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,605
You're sure?

36
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,406
Yeah.

37
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,740
You wouldn't have a chance.
The cops will be waiting for you.

38
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,887
We've gotta keep moving.

39
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,614
She'd listen to me though.
l know she would.

40
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,553
Would she?

41
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,921
Why?

42
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,663
l'm gonna go call Ed.

43
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,631
Stay here.

44
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,638
Hi, Ed? Hi, it's Donna.

45
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:36,178
Listen, l don't have a lot of time,
but l think James is in trouble.

46
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,613
Well, he's been working
for this woman.

47
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,083
Working on her car,

48
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:43,984
and l think
there's been this accident and...

49
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,853
Hi, how are you doing, Yvette?

50
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,621
Listen, l heard about
your new boyfriend.

51
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:53,163
Yeah, that's great, really.

52
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,425
Good to hear it.

53
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,925
So tell me about him.

54
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,908
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Frank.

55
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,882
What were you doing
at Shelly's house last night, Bobby?

56
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:14,816
Shelly almost gets murdered and
you're worried about what l'm doing?

57
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,012
What about Leostein?

58
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,522
What were you doing
at Shelly's house?

59
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,424
Look, here's the deal.

60
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,225
Shelly and l are together, okay?

61
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,301
We have been for a long time,
since before Laura died,

62
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,564
before and after Leo
went into his drool mode.

63
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,001
Bobby?

64
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:38,303
Where were you
the night the mill burned?

65
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,502
What's that got to do with this?

66
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,807
Leo tried to kill you.

67
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,974
- Maybe you shot him.
- No way.

68
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,143
l went to Shelly's
the night the mill burned down,

69
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,652
because l was worried about her.

70
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,346
He was about to bury an ax
in my head

71
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,389
when Hank Jennings shot him
through the window.

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,085
- You sure it was Hank?
- Absolutely.

73
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,423
What's Hank's connection with Leo?

74
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:00,327
l don't know, man.
Why don't you tell me?

75
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,493
Shelly, do you have any idea
where Leo might be now?

76
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,167
No, l don't.

77
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:11,434
l'll assign a couple of my deputies
to the house 24 hours a day.

78
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,670
Hey, man,
l can take care of Shelly all right.

79
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,508
You can just save the deputies.

80
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,876
Bobby Briggs,

81
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,109
button it.

82
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,583
- You can go now.
- Okay.

83
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:25,919
Shelly, don't worry, we're not
gonna let you out of our sight.

84
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,957
- Thank you.
- Come on, Shelly.

85
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,029
l feel so much safer,
don't you, Shelly?

86
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:32,596
Bobby.

87
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,408
Get a life, punk.

88
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,872
Gentlemen.

89
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,477
Another trip on the ''Seattle
to Twin Peaks'' shuttle.

90
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,977
How are you?

91
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,446
- Looking good, Harry.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,585
- Albert.
- Coop.

93
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,210
- Gentlemen.
- What have you got?

94
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,414
My invite back to Twin Peaks.

95
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,826
Windom Earle.
Direct orders from Gordon Cole.

96
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,620
As he so succinctly put it:

97
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,424
''l'm worried about Coop.''

98
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,469
Springfield, Kansas City,
Lawton, Dallas, Jackson.

99
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,305
Earle's been sending
gift-wrapped packages

100
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,846
to police departments
and major law enforcement agencies.

101
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,609
Each looks like a mail bomb,
but they turn out to be harmless.

102
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,811
The deliveries were paid for by a phony
credit card signed Windom Earle.

103
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,785
What's in the boxes?

104
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:33,653
One article of clothing in each.

105
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:40,693
One, a white veil, two, a garter,
three, a pair of white slippers,

106
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:45,429
four, a pearl necklace,
and finally, a wedding dress.

107
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,863
Caroline's.

108
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:51,771
He's got DEA and FBl,
not to mention Mississippi, Oklahoma

109
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,277
and lllinois State patrols
looking for him.

110
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,711
Everyone's invited to the party.

111
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,147
But my guess is, he won't dance
with anyone but you, Coop.

112
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,854
The vagrant from the office died
from a knife wound severing the aorta.

113
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,656
This guy's finger is pointed
directly at this chess piece.

114
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,322
How did Earle manage that
with the rigor mortis?

115
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,195
Well, rigor mortis goes
from head to toe.

116
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,167
But after two days,
it leaves the body from toe to head.

117
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,864
So he waited for it to leave
the arms and the fingers

118
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,169
so they could be maneuvered
onto the chess board.

119
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:28,906
And then he played Zeus
at the power station.

120
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,310
- What was found?
- This map.

121
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,975
Taped to the bottom of a table.

122
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,121
Good work, Albert.

123
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,866
He's making his move.
Most definitely.

124
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,763
Yeah.

125
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:56,369
Oh, Coop, about the uniform.

126
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,838
Yes, Albert?

127
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,172
Replacing the quiet elegance
of the dark suit and tie

128
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:03,372
with the casual indifference
of these muted earth tones

129
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:07,679
is a form of fashion suicide,
but call me crazy.

130
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,845
On you, it works.

131
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,948
Thank you, Albert.

132
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,689
You're awake then.

133
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,593
l trust you've slept well?

134
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:59,431
While you've slept,
l've learned all about you.

135
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,572
Leo Johnson.

136
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:06,075
The police would like to see you
as soon as possible.

137
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:09,237
Now, let me see.

138
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,481
Drug trafficking.

139
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,711
Arson.

140
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,522
Attempted murder.

141
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:24,129
Domestic violence.
Now l am partial to that.

142
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:29,160
Well, Leo, l've cleansed your wounds.

143
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,461
You're on the mend.

144
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:34,034
l've removed the proverbial thorn
from your paw.

145
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,738
Leo. Leo the lion.

146
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,336
Now...

147
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,210
l want you to help me.

148
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,443
And obey me.

149
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,552
Will you do that?

150
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:54,556
Did you know that,
in the 1 3th century in Japan,

151
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,559
the samurai were stripped
of their weaponry.

152
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:01,962
But they discovered that the aged
and treated bamboo

153
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:07,664
of their shakuhachi flute
made an excellent cudgel.

154
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:14,876
This flute
is truly an instrument of pleasure.

155
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,845
Don't you think?

156
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,815
l wanted to save this necklace
for an occasion,

157
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,356
but you've ruined it.

158
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,664
Now...

159
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,234
Come over here.

160
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,404
l've made you some gruel.

161
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,912
Come on, Leo, eat your gruel.

162
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,384
Yum, yum.

163
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:08,133
lt's been 20 years, babe.

164
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:11,566
One day we're talking
about a graduation party

165
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,205
and the next day we're here.

166
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:19,878
And in between
nothing but a world of hurt.

167
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,986
l tried not to think about it.

168
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,123
l just spent
more and more time at the diner,

169
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,124
trying to make the place work.

170
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,762
Because l had nothing else.

171
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,631
We were open every day,

172
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:45,471
so l wouldn't have to have
another life.

173
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:49,238
No birthdays,

174
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:51,501
no Fourth of July,

175
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,870
no Christmas.

176
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:03,945
Well, l turned all my Christmases
into a week full of Mondays.

177
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,683
When that didn't work,

178
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:11,796
l thought about all the presents
l never bought you.

179
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,159
Never got to give you.

180
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,367
l bought you a present
last Christmas.

181
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,500
lt was a turquoise and onyx bolo tie.

182
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,915
l walked over to your house
to give it to you,

183
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,783
but l couldn't go in.

184
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,854
l just waited.

185
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,355
l could see you through the window.

186
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,655
l don't know why l couldn't go in.

187
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,833
l'm sorry l didn't.

188
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,799
All that time,

189
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,236
you should have been in my home.

190
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,008
ln my bed.

191
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,383
lt's about the future now, Ed.

192
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,147
And what we're gonna do about it.

193
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:16,392
l want you to come tonight
after l close the diner.

194
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,553
Take me home.

195
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,198
You're right.

196
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,664
lt's all ahead of us.

197
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,827
Plenty of time.

198
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,832
Eddie?

199
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:31,033
- Eddie?
- No, no, no.

200
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,678
l may as well talk to her now.

201
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,384
Hello, Nadine.

202
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:53,588
l got all the way
to the district finals at Knife River,

203
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:58,897
only to find out
the airplane slam is illegal.

204
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:03,067
l was disqualified.

205
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,439
Second place, what a drag.

206
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,877
Oh, boy, what a tough break, huh?

207
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,516
Hello, Nadine.

208
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:18,146
l owe you an apology, Norma.

209
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:22,522
l mean, l really pounded Hank
and l am sorry.

210
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,827
But l thought he was gonna do
something to Eddie.

211
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,234
And l sort of got mad.

212
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,931
Thank you.

213
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,408
Know what?

214
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,041
l know about you guys.

215
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,943
lt's really, really okay.

216
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,682
Because l don't have to feel so guilty
about me and Mike.

217
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,155
You and Mike?

218
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,988
l don't wanna get into it,
but l have to tell you,

219
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,496
it is really, really serious.

220
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,966
So you guys can go ahead
and do whatever you want.

221
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:09,202
l am completely cool
about all of this.

222
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,500
Really.

223
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:33,794
Josie...

224
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,398
This is it.

225
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:41,233
The Seattle police want answers
and l have to tell them something.

226
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,870
They know you were connected
with Jonathan.

227
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,510
How did he die?

228
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:50,113
He was shot three times
in the back of the head.

229
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,846
Josie...

230
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,412
lf you were ever gonna tell the truth,

231
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,155
now would be an ideal time.

232
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,764
Think l'll get another cup of joe.

233
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,439
ls that you, Pete?

234
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:27,015
- Yeah. Cooper?
- Yeah.

235
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:31,087
l get over to the Clean and Save

236
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:35,091
and Jeanie Pombelek
is working the counter.

237
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,594
She does not speak
one word of English.

238
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,699
Nada, zip.

239
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:43,960
She's from Budapest.

240
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,967
We just stood there
and looked at each other

241
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,367
like we were made of wood.

242
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,907
Who does all this belong to, Pete?

243
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,378
Catherine's been running her
into the ground.

244
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,311
- Need a hand?
- So l offered to stop

245
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:01,977
by the dry cleaners
and pick up Josie's stuff.

246
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:06,921
You know, the only words l know
in Hungarian are paprika and goulash.

247
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,117
lt took me 20 minutes
to get this stuff.

248
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,955
Let me get that. Give me a hand.

249
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,464
Hello.

250
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,331
Just hold a minute.

251
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:24,067
- lt's for Josie. ls she here?
- She's in the other room, Pete.

252
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,763
- Hello.
- Josie.

253
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,663
lt's Thomas.

254
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,862
l'm so glad l've found you.

255
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,234
l was wondering
if we could get together.

256
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:02,040
Did you hear about
what happened to Jonathan?

257
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,677
Dreadful.

258
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,317
Dreadful.

259
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:10,482
Welcome to Twin Peaks,
Mr. Eckhardt.

260
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,657
She's run back to Catherine Martell.

261
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,664
l'm so disappointed.

262
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,576
So l asked Stonewall Jackson
what he would like to do

263
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,747
after we run the Yankees
up to Canada.

264
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:40,511
He said: ''Follow them.
l wanna be the Duke of Montreal.''

265
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,012
Oh, that Stonewall.

266
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,350
l once asked him

267
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:49,324
what he thought
l should do with Lincoln.

268
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:53,389
And he says, ''Old Honest Abe
is about as useful to you

269
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:58,196
as a spittoon cleaner
in a whorehouse.''

270
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:04,735
Traveler.

271
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,378
What do you think, Dr. Jacoby?

272
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,413
Letting him out to mingle with the
public doesn't seem to have helped.

273
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,949
Well, you have to admit,
he's kind of fun this way.

274
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:16,178
What's the matter with you?
That's my father, your brother.

275
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:19,051
We can't leave him like this.

276
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,021
Well, now, Audrey, honey, now.

277
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:26,392
There are some advantages
to leaving him...insane.

278
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,058
--told me that every man,
woman and child...

279
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,795
Now, Audrey,
you know l was upset too,

280
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:36,601
but there's some projects,
both domestic and international,

281
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,299
that l'd might get a chance
to develop.

282
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:42,914
l mean, one man's crisis
is another man's opportunity.

283
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,913
Let me tell you something,
Uncle Jerry.

284
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:49,919
We leave him the way he is,
and l become executor of the estate.

285
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,580
Audrey, it's a little more complicated
than that, sweetheart.

286
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,727
No, it isn't.
l've examined his will, Jerry.

287
00:21:55,894 --> 00:22:00,422
lf my father becomes incapacitated,
it all goes to me when l'm old enough.

288
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,627
And l am old enough, Jer,
and he is incapacitated.

289
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,136
l have my way either way.

290
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,670
When the only project
you'll be developing

291
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,904
is selling baseboard heaters
at the local Cash 'n' Carry.

292
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,942
What's happened to the man
is a tragedy.

293
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,645
lt is a tragedy, Jer.

294
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:32,697
Dr. Jacoby,
l want you to bring my father back.

295
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,492
- To the office?
- Parade, rest!

296
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,636
To the real world.

297
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:43,472
l think it's time we implement
the Appomattox scenario.

298
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:47,036
Hey, sorry l'm late. A couple of bikers
tried to take this jacket.

299
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:49,646
But old Stonewall's
gone from me now,

300
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,942
cut down in a hail of Yankee lead.

301
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,983
He died alone,

302
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:57,645
without my comfort.

303
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:58,847
Laddy.

304
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,659
Come here.

305
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,224
You know what l wanna hear.
Troops, about face.

306
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,797
''Dixie.'' ''Dixie''!

307
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,059
Forward, march.

308
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:15,298
Oh, l wish l was in the land of cotton

309
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:18,500
Old times there were not forgotten

310
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:25,378
Look away, look away, look away
Dixie land

311
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:26,677
Oh, l wish...

312
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,762
Mrs. Marsh?

313
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:50,465
l'm Donna, James' friend.

314
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,540
l remember you.

315
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,545
Get the lady here a drink.

316
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,207
With a little umbrella in it.

317
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,944
Go on, dear, sit down, it's all right.

318
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:06,057
- Why are you doing this to James?
- Why not?

319
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:07,920
Because he's a good person.

320
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:11,287
He was good at two things:

321
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,488
The car and me.

322
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,364
You don't get it, do you?
l'm talking about our lives.

323
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:23,600
Life. Life will be rosy if you can
just get out of one silly little jam.

324
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,368
Maybe.

325
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,569
Maybe not.

326
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,042
Talk to me in a couple of years

327
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:31,614
when your whole life
has turned to crap.

328
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,445
You really like to make everything
sound pointless and stupid.

329
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:38,714
lf there was a reason to climb out
of this primeval swill,

330
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:41,415
believe me, dear, l'd know it.

331
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:42,958
Would you, really?

332
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:47,656
Oh, here we are.
The car's waiting, Mrs. Marsh.

333
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,562
Get in it.

334
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:59,972
l'm sorry about your friend, honey.
There's nothing you can do.

335
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,637
So why don't you trundle along
to your little town,

336
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:08,651
safe in the knowledge that,
if l ever see you here again,

337
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:11,322
l'll kill you.

338
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:17,587
Don't do this to him, please.

339
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,628
Please.

340
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,372
Coop, take a look at this.

341
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,980
Vicuna thread sample
taken from Josie's coat.

342
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:42,780
Traces found on the floor
outside your room.

343
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,786
They're from the same coat?

344
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:47,824
Let me put it to you this way,
either Josie Packard pulled the trigger,

345
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,154
or she's loaning her winter wear
to the wrong people.

346
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:52,229
- lt's a perfect match.
- What about the gloves?

347
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,991
Checking for powder burns.
l'll have the results in the morning.

348
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,191
From the Seattle Homicide?

349
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,665
Locals are looking
for a beautiful Asian woman,

350
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:02,102
late 20s, in connection with the murder
of one Jonathan Kumagai.

351
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,366
He has an lnterpol sheet
as long as your arm

352
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,976
and three holes
in the back of his head.

353
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:10,706
l'm betting the bullets will match
the slugs we took from your vest.

354
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,808
l hope it's not Josie,
for Harry's sake.

355
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:19,688
Coop, as you know, Truman and l
have had our differences in the past.

356
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:23,157
But the big lug's got his heart
in the right place, if nothing else.

357
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:26,422
And l'm not above feeling a little
sympathy for the stalwart and the dull.

358
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,497
- What's you point, Albert?
- Speaking frankly?

359
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,567
Feel free.

360
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:34,001
Our sheriff's got a serious problem
with his girlfriend.

361
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,406
Albert,

362
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,413
not one word until we're certain.

363
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,455
Coop.

364
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,450
Our John Doe's got a name:

365
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,426
Erik Powell. Transient.
Former merchant marine by his prints.

366
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:00,224
Powell?

367
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,933
Yeah, ring a bell?

368
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,870
Powell was Caroline's
maiden name.

369
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:11,541
Do you think
this Powell is a relative?

370
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,305
No. Earle's playing the game
according to his own rules.

371
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,141
Every move he makes
sends a message.

372
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:19,807
The fact that he chose
the name Powell

373
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:22,545
tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing
that went on between us.

374
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,686
So whenever he takes a piece
from the board...

375
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:29,224
Someone dies.

376
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:33,124
l never beat him, Harry.

377
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:35,732
Coop, if you've got a need
for a chess expert,

378
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,994
we've got one of the best
right here in town.

379
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,797
Checkmate.

380
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,999
Checkmate.

381
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,710
And mate.

382
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:55,317
Frankly, l am impressed.

383
00:27:56,088 --> 00:28:00,320
l owe it all
to the great Jose Raul Capablanca.

384
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:02,790
Now, if there's chess boards
in heaven,

385
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:05,327
Jose's sitting next to the Lord.

386
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,625
- Doc?
- The mind reels.

387
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,030
One of these days.

388
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,636
Pete, l need your help.

389
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,137
l'm playing a chess match
of considerable importance.

390
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,536
l can't say any more than that.

391
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,644
Suffice to say,
l'd like to stalemate the game,

392
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:25,283
losing as few pieces as possible.
None, if that can be arranged.

393
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,251
Well, Agent Cooper,
l'd be proud to serve.

394
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:32,286
Thanks, Pete.

395
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:36,553
Great players are either far or few.

396
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,070
- Hi.
- Shelly.

397
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,471
l'm sorry about what happened.

398
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,408
Are you okay?

399
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,312
Not really.

400
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:00,515
l wanted to come right over,

401
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,984
but with Hank gone,
it's been a madhouse here.

402
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:08,691
You don't need any help, do you?

403
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,653
l... l'd...

404
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,393
l'd feel safer, Norma.

405
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,366
Are you kidding?

406
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,697
lt hasn't been the same without you.

407
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:22,931
When can you start?

408
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,369
- Now?
- Great. Welcome back.

409
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,549
Thank you.

410
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:32,740
Norma?

411
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,213
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hi.

412
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:38,379
Excuse me.
l need to talk to you for a minute.

413
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,789
There's something you should know.

414
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,935
Hank's nearly ready
to leave the hospital.

415
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:53,731
What about his parole violations?

416
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,135
Harry, this time
l don't want him back.

417
00:29:56,341 --> 00:30:00,243
Don't worry. He won't be back.
Hank's going to jail.

418
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,812
We're charging him with
the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.

419
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,211
Add that to breaking parole,

420
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:08,375
Hank's going away for a long time.

421
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:11,949
Good.

422
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:36,313
Mr. Eckhardt, welcome.

423
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:39,575
Josie, help our guest with his coat.

424
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:50,859
l must confess l received
your invitation with some surprise.

425
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,827
Well, word travels fast
in Twin Peaks.

426
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:57,799
l thought it was fitting that l dined
with my late brother's business rival.

427
00:30:57,969 --> 00:30:59,436
Some wine, Josie.

428
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:02,038
Your brother was not always my rival.
We were friends.

429
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:04,708
- But your friendship soured.
- Sadly.

430
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,141
Men of business frequently find
their personal lives disrupted

431
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,304
by the larger portraits they paint.

432
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:13,679
You consider yourself an artist?
The wine, Josie.

433
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:17,288
Of a sort. Your brother was as well.

434
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,548
l wonder, Mr. Eckhardt.

435
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:23,455
When you had him killed,
was it for art or money?

436
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:27,120
- Don't stand there, Josie, pour.
- Call me Thomas. Your brother did.

437
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,359
Thomas. We'll have
our hors d'oeuvres now, Josie.

438
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,628
One does not kill for art or money.

439
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:36,331
They are commodities easily lost
and just as easily gained.

440
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:42,879
However, one, rather l,
might find reason to kill for love.

441
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,916
- Did you love her that much?
- Yes.

442
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,713
Josie has the most
incredible hands.

443
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,913
Every finger a thing of beauty.

444
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,024
l remember.

445
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:01,899
l wonder,
what shall we do about her?

446
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:05,662
lt would be a shame
if you left empty-handed.

447
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:10,202
Of course,
l'll miss her cheery disposition.

448
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,775
We've become the best of friends.

449
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,878
Two girls chatting over tea.

450
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:17,674
Perhaps you should purchase
an animal of some kind.

451
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:19,180
A cat or a dog.

452
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:22,615
lf l give her to you,
what will you give me in return?

453
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:26,847
How can l place a value
on something so precious?

454
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:33,225
But you will try?

455
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,722
Yes.

456
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,228
Josie.

457
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,999
Thomas and l
will have our main course now.

458
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,564
Why did you do it?

459
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:23,573
You know l've been going through it.

460
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:26,478
- l can't figure it out.
- James, you're not safe here.

461
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:29,279
- lf Malcolm finds you--
- ls it the money?

462
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,922
ls that it? No. No, l got it.

463
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,493
lt was Malcolm. Oh, yeah.
He made you do it. Right?

464
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:40,461
You better tell me a story, Evelyn.
Because l'm all mixed up.

465
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,463
l just wanna know
why you would do this to me.

466
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,499
James.

467
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:51,269
What did you expect? An apology?
A hidden heart of gold?

468
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:54,173
l did it all, James. l did everything.

469
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:58,476
l found you, l lured you in
and l kept you here,

470
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,814
while Malcolm planned
a nice, neat little frame.

471
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:06,714
- Why?
- For the money.

472
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,620
Out of fear.

473
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:11,660
Because l wanted to do it.

474
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,357
lt's not exactly what you wanted
to hear, is it, James?

475
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:18,331
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

476
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:25,074
James, you're good
and you're honest.

477
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:27,370
l'm not.

478
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,240
But that doesn't mean
there weren't moments

479
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,008
when l truly wanted you here.

480
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:35,179
Not for Malcolm,

481
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:38,754
or for the money, but for me.

482
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,983
For the good and honest way
that you taste.

483
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,728
l like how you taste too.

484
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:57,565
Malcolm, what did you do?
James, James. You hurt him.

485
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:05,113
He broke into the house,

486
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:08,343
he was angry, he was crazy.

487
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,753
He killed Jeffrey
and he came back to kill you.

488
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,756
You poor, defenseless little widow.

489
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,454
But you were ready for him, Evelyn.

490
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:21,791
You got your gun,

491
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,560
and you shot James.

492
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:27,364
You shot him until he was dead.

493
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:05,235
- General Lee.
- Whoa.

494
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,182
Welcome to our humble horse--
Home, General Lee.

495
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,013
- Thank you. And you are...?
- Scarlett McLean.

496
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,018
And this is my father--

497
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,986
This is my father.

498
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,595
Wilmer McLean at your service.

499
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:28,789
l'm indeed honored to be making
your extremely sociable acquaintance.

500
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:32,630
And why are you armed
with my sword, sir?

501
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:35,102
l like your sword, sire.

502
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:38,867
- Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.
- Where is General Grant?

503
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,578
General Grant's a-coming, sire,
l know it.

504
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,543
Excuse us.

505
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:55,785
General Grant.

506
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:57,621
General Lee.

507
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:01,322
Sir, we met during the Mexican War.
Do you remember?

508
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:03,831
l have come to surrender the North.

509
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:06,196
The Mexican War, sir.
Do you remember?

510
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:09,340
Oh, yes, yes.
lt was a good war, as l remember.

511
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,999
Nonsense.
All wars are nothing but madness.

512
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:17,307
Disguised as the patriotic ventures
of politicians,

513
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,918
too old and too cowardly
to participate in them.

514
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:23,986
- No, no, sir, l have no love for war.
- Me neither.

515
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,521
- And even less for politicians.
- Hey, amen.

516
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:30,320
But, as for the men who fight them,

517
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:35,432
they have my eternal respect
and sympathy.

518
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:40,698
All right, general,
enough of this fruitless conversation.

519
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,170
My terms:

520
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:46,435
Federal officers
may keep their sidearms

521
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:49,375
and other general possessions.

522
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:53,449
Officers and men claiming to own
their own horses may keep them too.

523
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:58,555
And officers and men will be allowed
to return to their home,

524
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:02,215
not to be disturbed
by the Confederate States' authorities.

525
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:05,829
- l surrender.
- Of course you do.

526
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,194
The articles.

527
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:13,562
- Here, sire, the articles.
- Sir.

528
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,035
The articles, sir.

529
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,101
- You will sign, General Grant.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

530
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:24,647
And may l add that, that you've been
a valiant opponent of fine character.

531
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,443
l thought the North won
the Civil War?

532
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,226
Ben?

533
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,367
Ben.

534
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:50,666
Daddy.

535
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,603
- Ben? Ben?
- Daddy?

536
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:58,476
Hey, give him some room.

537
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,446
Where am l?

538
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:03,621
- Where am l?
- Twin Peaks, Ben.

539
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:10,420
l had the strangest dream.

540
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:14,931
And you were there.

541
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:18,500
And you, and you.

542
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,097
lt was incredible.

543
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:23,536
lt was a war.

544
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,142
And l was General...

545
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,802
General Robert E. Lee.

546
00:39:30,548 --> 00:39:35,349
And somehow,
in spite of incredible odds,

547
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,479
l won.

548
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,614
Now you're home, Daddy.

549
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:41,553
Yes.

550
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,791
- l'm home.
- Attaboy, Ben.

551
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:49,797
How do you feel?
Any, any aftereffects? Dizziness?

552
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,668
l feel terrific.

553
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:58,005
- l feel...
- Yes?

554
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:01,736
- What is it, Daddy?
- What are you doing in those clothes?

555
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,076
Attaboy, Ben.

556
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,488
What? What's the joke?

557
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,892
Attaboy, Ben.

558
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,698
Work slowly.

559
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:27,268
And with care.

560
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:33,740
Everything must be written
with a steady, uncompromising hand.

561
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,043
No, no, no.

562
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,946
Terrible.

563
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,747
Erase.

564
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,013
Erase.

565
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,686
Now...

566
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,763
Try again.

567
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:59,563
Concentrate.

568
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,004
Leo, for heaven's sake.

569
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,377
Here.

570
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:10,270
Let me show you.

571
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:12,039
Like this:

572
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,911
There you go.

573
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:17,714
Much better.

574
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:22,556
l am proud of you, Leo.

575
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:39,175
- Windom Earle?
- Yes.

576
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,173
Windom.

577
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:47,615
Pretty words for pretty girls.

578
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:50,618
Which one shall be my queen?

579
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:53,148
Queen?

580
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:01,063
No. No.

581
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:02,596
No.

582
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,629
Lick.

583
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,447
The story rings a little truer
with your fingerprints on--

584
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,676
No, Malcolm, l can't.

585
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:24,344
Just your prints.
Leave the rest to me.

586
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,853
l'll do my best to imitate
the actions of a hysteric.

587
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,958
Five shots, tightly grouped,

588
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,993
as though the gun went off
in your hand.

589
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:34,187
- Repeatedly.
- No!

590
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:38,994
No! No! James, James, James.

591
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,571
- Don't hurt him any more, please.
- Give me the gun.

592
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,072
l've called the cops.
They're on their way, it won't work.

593
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,040
- Malcolm.
- She's lying. Give me the gun.

594
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:51,045
Evelyn,
please don't let him die, please.

595
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:53,706
- Please.
- Evelyn.

596
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:56,813
Give me the gun, Evelyn.

597
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:59,252
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

598
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:02,017
- Evelyn, give me the gun.
- No.

599
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:05,327
Evelyn. Evelyn.

600
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:08,195
l can't do this, Malcolm.

601
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:10,659
Then l will.

602
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,069
No.

603
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,284
He was angry,

604
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:39,189
he was crazy.

605
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:44,062
He killed Jeffrey,
came back to kill me.

606
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:46,463
l was ready, though.

607
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:51,140
l got my gun and l shot him.

608
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:55,245
l shot him till he was dead.

609
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,599
Caroline.

610
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,950
For Miss Audrey Horne, please.

611
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,849
Owls?

612
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:25,895
Breathtaking, wasn't she?

613
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,733
A truly beautiful woman, Caroline.

614
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,340
Funny, isn't it?

615
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,033
After all this time,

616
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:37,080
after all that happened
in Pittsburgh,

617
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:40,148
l still love her.

618
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:43,343
And l know that you do too.

619
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:47,582
Now, Dale, listen carefully.

620
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,920
lt's your move.
