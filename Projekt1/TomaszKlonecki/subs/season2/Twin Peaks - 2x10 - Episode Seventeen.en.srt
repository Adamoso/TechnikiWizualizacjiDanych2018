1
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:04,202
Sarah.

2
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,067
I'd Iike you to take this.

3
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,877
Doc,

4
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,139
I don't want it.

5
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,408
I don't want it.

6
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,711
I wanna be there.

7
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,980
Every part of me needs to be there.

8
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,215
For both of them.

9
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,119
Today I bury my husband.

10
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,762
Next to my onIy chiId.

11
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,836
Her grave is stiII so...

12
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:41,906
...new. There's onIy
a IittIe bit of grass on it.

13
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,610
Mrs. PaImer, there are things
dark and heinous in this worId.

14
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:53,582
Things too horribIe
to teII our chiIdren.

15
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,282
Your husband feII victim
to one of these Iong ago,

16
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,915
when he was innocent and trusting.

17
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,791
LeIand did not do these things.
Not the LeIand that you knew.

18
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,523
No.

19
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,327
That man I saw.

20
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:14,997
Long, dirty, disgusting hair.

21
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,110
He's gone. Forever.

22
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,781
So is everything I Ioved.

23
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,017
Sarah.

24
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:33,885
I think it might heIp to teII you what
happened just before LeIand died.

25
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:40,395
It's hard to reaIize here and here

26
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,468
what has transpired.

27
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:49,303
Your husband went so far as
to drug you to keep his actions secret.

28
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,239
But before he died,

29
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:55,575
LeIand confronted the horror
of what he had done to Laura

30
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:59,582
and agonized over the pain
he had caused you.

31
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,918
LeIand died at peace.

32
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:09,221
In his Iast moments, he saw Laura.

33
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,092
He kept saying
how much he Ioved her.

34
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,268
And I beIieve she weIcomed him,

35
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,903
that she forgave him.

36
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,370
It's time.

37
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:43,924
Mrs. PaImer, I wouId be honored
to drive you.

38
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,202
LeIand aIways found
the other earring.

39
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:27,895
- I don't know about you...
- Excuse me.

40
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:32,664
Get some of this WaIdorf saIad here.
There we go.

41
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,206
- Nice to see you too.
- Yeah.

42
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,383
I got this for Sarah.

43
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,588
Here you go.

44
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:04,260
- WhiIe it's hot.
- Oh, thank you very much.

45
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:12,267
Do they invite peopIe to these things,
or do they just show up?

46
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:16,515
At a time Iike this,
peopIe just naturaIIy come together.

47
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:19,743
It's a time of reaching out.

48
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,752
I remember when my mother died,

49
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,390
there must have been
a hundred peopIe.

50
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,225
Seems Iike the whoIe town
is faIIing apart.

51
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:38,565
Somehow James thinks it's his fauIt.

52
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:41,229
First Laura, then Maddy.

53
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,604
Maybe he bIames me, I don't know.

54
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:48,043
Two peopIe in Iove couIdn't have
caused aII this, couId they?

55
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,409
Oh, honey.

56
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:53,310
He'II come back.

57
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,386
Everything's gonna get better.

58
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,224
- WeIcome home, Dr. Jacoby.
- Major.

59
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:08,728
You appear to be fuIIy recovered
from your recent setback.

60
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:13,566
WeII, nothing beats the restorative
powers of HanaIei Bay.

61
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,907
- Sheriff, how are you?
- Major.

62
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,843
What's the matter?

63
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,172
Doesn't she feed you?

64
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,976
- You're just jeaIous.
- JeaIous?

65
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:33,285
Oh, I... I... I wouIdn't... I wouIdn't
spend my time changing diapers.

66
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,423
What's next for you, sir?

67
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,026
WeII, major, I'm not exactIy sure.

68
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,860
I've stockpiIed a few weeks
of vacation time.

69
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,763
Now might be the time
to cash them in.

70
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,837
For starters,
wouId you care to join me

71
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:49,702
for an incredibIy pIeasant evening
of night fishing?

72
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,701
Aces.

73
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,469
Eddie,

74
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:58,777
can you see my underpants
in my shoes?

75
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:05,014
I Iooked down and I thought
I couId see the refIection.

76
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:11,627
Do you think boys
are Iooking up my dress?

77
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,997
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing
in your shoes.

78
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,193
I promise.

79
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,629
Okay.

80
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,073
Donna came over to see Laura.

81
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,742
Do you know what they did?

82
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,014
It was Iate. We'd made popcorn.

83
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,560
And they made this very serious
promise to each other,

84
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,254
to be best friends forever.

85
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,332
I... I think it was a kind of bond

86
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,163
against...

87
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,066
Dying.

88
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,843
I need to remember aII this.

89
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,447
Besides, she's cursed.

90
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:13,357
Boys, take it easy.
Take it easy. Come on.

91
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,962
I'm gonna stick his head in the gutter
where it beIongs.

92
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,766
Dwayne, now knock it off.
Knock it off.

93
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,871
Remember where you are
and why we're here.

94
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,666
PIease.

95
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:35,043
They seem to be having fun.

96
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:40,143
The mayor and his brother.

97
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,447
Dougie owns the newspaper.

98
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:46,251
They've had a running feud
going for 50 years.

99
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,757
Nobody knows how it started.

100
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,225
Something about an oId fIame
and a rumbIe seat.

101
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,455
I don't even think
they remember anymore.

102
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,998
WeII, the nest's a IittIe stirred up
right now.

103
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:59,297
Dougie's engaged to be married
to a babe.

104
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,667
For the fifth time.

105
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:05,333
She's stiII in her teens, he's 1 1 0.

106
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:09,743
One of those January-December
sort of deaIs.

107
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,408
You remember the first time Dwayne
ran for mayor? When was that?

108
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,953
Sixty-two? Yeah, 1 962.

109
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,328
Dougie wrote an editoriaI,
came out against Dwayne.

110
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,589
And Dwayne was
running unopposed.

111
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,633
Harry, I'm reaIIy gonna miss
this pIace.

112
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,476
You're asking me to admit
a 35-year-oId woman

113
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,310
to the senior cIass.

114
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:48,177
You got me there.

115
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,289
Eddie, how much Ionger?
CIass is starting.

116
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,221
We'II be right out, Nadine.
Just a few more minutes.

117
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:55,952
Guess what.

118
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:57,493
CheerIeading tryouts today.

119
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,654
I just saw a notice
on the buIIetin board.

120
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,062
That's great, honey.

121
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,327
Why don't you go
practice your spIits?

122
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:07,871
Okay.

123
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,217
BeIIman?

124
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:29,217
Customer reIations.

125
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,728
Has everything been satisfactory
during your stay with us, Mr. Cooper?

126
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,360
Audrey, I have no compIaints.

127
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:40,834
- When are you Ieaving?
- Going fishing.

128
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,308
But you are Ieaving.

129
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,243
Yes, in effect I am.

130
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,412
So this is it? You save my Iife,
then break my heart?

131
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,559
Audrey, I've expIained to you
my personaI poIicy about invoIving--

132
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,560
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm a teenager.

133
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,891
And you were invoIved
in a case I was working on.

134
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:18,037
Someone must have hurt you once
reaIIy badIy.

135
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:24,210
No. Someone was hurt by me.

136
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,916
And I wiII never Iet that
happen again.

137
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:32,156
What happened,
did she die or something?

138
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,752
As a matter of fact, she did.

139
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,224
You wanna know how?

140
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:45,837
She was a materiaI witness
to a federaI crime.

141
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,905
We were supposed to protect her.

142
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,235
Twenty-four hours a day.

143
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,978
My partner and I.

144
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:55,913
Windom EarIe was his name.

145
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,174
He taught me everything I know
about being a speciaI agent.

146
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,021
And when the attempt on her Iife
was finaIIy made,

147
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,521
I wasn't ready.

148
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,026
Because I Ioved her.

149
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,326
She died in my arms.

150
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,637
I was badIy injured,

151
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:22,967
and my partner Iost his mind.

152
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,139
Need to hear any more?

153
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:36,218
Audrey, I Iike you
and I care about you.

154
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,720
I'II aIways consider you my friend.

155
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,657
Friendship is the foundation
of any Iasting reIationship.

156
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,529
It's nice to be quoted accurateIy.

157
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,165
WeII, Iet me teII you something,
Agent Cooper.

158
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,305
One of these days,
before you know it,

159
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,838
I'm gonna be grown-up
and on my own,

160
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,999
and you better watch out.

161
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,376
Okay, Audrey. It's a deaI.

162
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:07,311
You know, there's onIy
one probIem with you.

163
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,351
You're perfect.

164
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,004
It's big.

165
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:32,235
But it is bad.

166
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,875
Leo just got that suit.

167
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:43,215
Fits him a IittIe tighter.

168
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,124
Yeah, it's a shame to Iet good threads
go to waste.

169
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,852
What do you think?

170
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,294
Green or yeIIow?

171
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:58,636
I gotta Iook good. Ben Horne is a man
who notices these things, you know?

172
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,602
Bobby, honey, you Iook great.

173
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,007
Can you take me out tonight, pIease?
I'II get aII dressed up.

174
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,745
What about Leo?
We just Ieave him here?

175
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:17,218
I don't know. I'II get a sitter.
I've gotta get out of this house.

176
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:21,050
Sweetheart, Iover, Iisten to me.

177
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:27,325
If I Iand this job with Ben Horne,
we're on easy street.

178
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,434
I'II take care of you in ways
you never even dreamed of.

179
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,627
Hang in there,

180
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:36,935
and Iet Bobby do his thing.

181
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:40,943
It's for both of us, okay?

182
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,649
I gotta rambIe.

183
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:50,418
Cross your fingers, cross your toes.
This is the big time.

184
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,113
Later.

185
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:14,436
HeIIo, Harry.

186
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:19,142
Forgive my saying so, Catherine...

187
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,377
...but aren't you dead?

188
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,484
Does Pete know?

189
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:28,889
My husband and I
wiII be duIy reunited.

190
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:33,122
WeII, aII things considered,
weIcome home.

191
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,834
- Any questions?
- Yeah, a coupIe.

192
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,665
Am I under suspicion?

193
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,831
I guess that depends
on the answers I get.

194
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:46,000
Maybe you'd Iike to caII your Iawyer.

195
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,243
That won't be necessary.

196
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:53,511
- I have nothing to hide.
- Good. Good.

197
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,847
WeII, for starters,

198
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:59,047
where the heII have you been
the past two weeks?

199
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,189
Harry.

200
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:04,756
Do you beIieve in guardian angeIs?

201
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,330
Guardian angeIs?

202
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,695
Catherine, to teII you the truth,

203
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:13,168
I'm not so sure what I beIieve
these days.

204
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:19,867
I beIieve an angeI saved my Iife.

205
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:24,008
I was home the night of the fire.

206
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:27,619
A man caIIed.
The voice, I didn't recognize.

207
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,255
He asked me to meet him
at the drying shed.

208
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:34,757
There was a vague threat impIied.
So I went and I took my gun.

209
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,191
And that girI... What's her name?

210
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,127
- SheIIy Johnson.
- Johnson. She was there.

211
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,597
She was tied up inside.

212
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,370
I think a bomb went off. I...

213
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:51,568
I have nothing but impressions after
that, just waIIs of fIame, screaming...

214
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:57,205
I have no idea of how I escaped.
But I found myseIf in the woods.

215
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:01,878
I was afraid.

216
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,718
I was afraid for the first time
in my Iife.

217
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:11,722
I dragged myseIf through the night.

218
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,492
Then, as the sky Iightened,

219
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:18,465
things began to Iook famiIiar.

220
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:24,074
The woods. The path.
A rock formation.

221
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,204
And I was...

222
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,642
...fIooded with...

223
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,951
...memories of my chiIdhood.

224
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:39,024
I thought, ''This is what heaven is.''

225
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,491
And that's when I saw
our oId summer cabin in the woods.

226
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:51,765
Heaven was PearI Lakes.
I'd waIked miIes through the night.

227
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,771
OnIy a guardian angeI
couId have brought me there.

228
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,808
Thank you.

229
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:06,713
Thank God we aIways kept
a weII-stocked pantry.

230
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:11,448
I went in and I...
I opened a can of tuna fish.

231
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:15,822
And I waited for whoever it was that
was trying to kiII me to finish the job.

232
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:19,526
A Ioaded gun by my side.

233
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:24,032
I was terrified that every moment
was going to be my Iast.

234
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:27,195
What made you come back?

235
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,865
I ran out of tuna fish.

236
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,371
Great news. I quit smoking.

237
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:37,539
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

238
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,547
I wanted...

239
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:44,519
To be honest, I wanted to taIk
about our bambino.

240
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,315
Our bambino?

241
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:50,189
Lucy, I have been in a ghastIy turmoiI,
and do you know what I've discovered?

242
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:54,025
I, Richard Tremayne,
am a terribIe, crashing bore.

243
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:58,260
And what I desperateIy require
in my Iife is something--

244
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:05,240
No, someone. --more important
than myseIf to think about, to care for.

245
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,347
So perhaps you can see why that,
as a resuIt, I must say,

246
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:13,007
parenthood is suddenIy
so appeaIing.

247
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,052
- Parenthood?
- Fatherhood, more specificaIIy.

248
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,689
And since I have no skiIIs
in this area--

249
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:22,190
Nurturing is a reIativeIy
foreign concept.

250
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:27,458
--I've enIisted myseIf in
the Happy HeIping Hand program.

251
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:33,128
Part-time big brother
to some adorabIe, homeIess waif.

252
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,867
Excuse me,
are you the same Dick Tremayne

253
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,239
that works at
Horne's Department Store?

254
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,745
Yes. And, Lucy, I must say,

255
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:48,615
I have absoIute confidence
that the chiId is mine.

256
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,854
Lucy.

257
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:58,127
Lucy, Dick, I have something
I'd Iike to say.

258
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,927
What is it, Andy?

259
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:07,368
I wouId Iike to say that we're aII
in a very difficuIt position.

260
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,599
I come from a Iarge famiIy.
And Mama aIways said

261
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,834
she couIdn't have
fussing and fighting around her

262
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,877
when she had a bun in the oven.

263
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:19,948
And untiI we know for sure
who's gonna be throwing that basebaII,

264
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,647
or buiIding that doIIhouse,
we shouId aII be friends.

265
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:47,802
So you two go right ahead and taIk,
and I'II see you.

266
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,316
Andy, are you crazy?

267
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,011
Hawk, I know Lucy
and I know what'd get her:

268
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:00,352
MoraIs and manIy behavior.

269
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:03,320
You think I went too far?

270
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,928
- Harry?
- Hey.

271
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:13,403
WeII, I guess this is goodbye.

272
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:17,303
Major Briggs says there's a frying pan
fuII of steeIhead trout out there

273
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,966
with my name on them.

274
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:22,545
That's why I figure
you're gonna be needing this.

275
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,087
Harry...

276
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:40,159
- ...this is unbeIievabIe.
- Yeah.

277
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,494
Now, when those steeIhead
are running upstream,

278
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,503
they're onIy thinking
about one thing. Sex.

279
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,870
A Green Butt Skunk
breaks their concentration.

280
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,035
A Green Butt Skunk.

281
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,075
Yeah.

282
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,844
Tied it myseIf.
My dad taught me how.

283
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,446
His dad taught him.

284
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,487
Harry, I don't know what to say.

285
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,558
Oh, one more thing.

286
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,199
I'II recycIe this.

287
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,500
Bookhouse Boy patch.

288
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:28,238
We aII agreed.
You're one of us now.

289
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:35,550
Harry, I am honored beyond
my abiIity to express myseIf.

290
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,586
You wear that in good heaIth.

291
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,726
You ever need us, we'II be there.

292
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,570
Deputy Hawk.

293
00:24:57,176 --> 00:25:00,543
If I'm ever Iost, I hope you're
the man they send to find me.

294
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,279
May the wind be aIways at your back.

295
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,479
Deputy Andy.

296
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,814
Your bravery is onIy exceeded
by the size of your heart.

297
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,786
A rare combination, indeed.

298
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,928
Lucy, my best to you and yours.

299
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,122
Now, you better invite me
to that wedding,

300
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,598
whoever the Iucky man might be.

301
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:30,801
- Sheriff Truman?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,671
This is SpeciaI Agent Roger Hardy
of the FBI.

303
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:35,608
Roger, what are you doing here?

304
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,044
DaIe, we've got a probIem.

305
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:40,651
Effective immediateIy, without pay,

306
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:45,222
I regret to inform you
of your suspension from the FBI.

307
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,897
Cooper, I suspect you know
why I'm here.

308
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,035
- I don't.
- InternaI Affairs.

309
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,364
We're the agents
who watch the agents.

310
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,167
And his presence refers
to my crossing into Canada.

311
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:06,539
HoId on, that was directIy reIated
to a case we were investigating.

312
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:08,703
Not without my knowing
about it, it wasn't.

313
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:11,076
What's the charge, Roger?
Misfeasance?

314
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,376
''Mis''-what?

315
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,576
The improper and unIawfuI execution
of an act

316
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:16,516
that is in itseIf proper and IawfuI.

317
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,883
- The rescue of Audrey Horne.
- In part.

318
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:23,221
There's aIso the disturbing aIIegation
as to your motives and your methods.

319
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,589
What aIIegation?

320
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:27,254
WeII, I'm waiting
for some evidence to arrive.

321
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,366
We'II convene in one hour.

322
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,502
AIone.

323
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:37,367
Come on. Think.

324
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,842
Mr. Horne wasn't expecting you.

325
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:51,888
He said that possibIy we couId
set something up for you next month.

326
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,958
CouId you teII him it's about the tape
he got in the maiI yesterday,

327
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,354
and it's urgent?

328
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:59,395
CouId you teII him that, pIease?

329
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:07,363
A IittIe Iate for HaIIoween, isn't it?

330
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,070
What?

331
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,211
Oh, what are you supposed to be,
a Iounge Iizard?

332
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,815
ShouIdn't you be in schooI?

333
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:23,044
SchooI numbs my buns.
What about you?

334
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,481
Oh, I'm just trying to get a meeting
with your father.

335
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,394
What on earth do you wanna
taIk to him about?

336
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,321
A job. Business. It's personaI.

337
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:39,270
I didn't know
Daddy dearest was hiring.

338
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:43,430
Oh, you know me.
I just gotta taIk to him first.

339
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:47,143
Yeah. You're up to something,
Bobby Briggs,

340
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:50,247
but I'm sure that's
none of my business.

341
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,315
Count to ten.

342
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,180
One,

343
00:27:58,357 --> 00:27:59,756
two,

344
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,688
three,

345
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,794
four,

346
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:06,089
five...

347
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:13,836
First ruIe of business
is you have to know who to speak to.

348
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,836
Audrey.

349
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:21,236
I owe you one.

350
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:30,753
I know you're a busy man,
I respect that. I'II get right to the point.

351
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,386
Samantha, bring in a fIy swatter.
There's a bug in my office.

352
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:42,028
Hey! You're making a big mistake.
Let me go!

353
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,330
Hey, hey, hey! Leave him aIone.
He's a friend of mine.

354
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:55,176
You couId teII your boss
that that tape was not the originaI.

355
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:00,908
- You okay?
- Yeah.

356
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,585
I can't imagine what aII this
is about, Bobby Briggs.

357
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,726
You know, that's twice
you saved my bacon, Audrey.

358
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,089
CouId be taIking sainthood.

359
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,696
Is there anything I can do for you?

360
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,893
How about an ice cream?

361
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,401
Cup or cone?

362
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,703
Cone. I Iike to Iick.

363
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,878
What was the purpose of your first visit
to One-Eyed Jack's?

364
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:33,381
To gather information about the death
of Laura PaImer from Jacques RenauIt.

365
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,213
Who you apparentIy Iured
back across the border,

366
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,253
where he was wounded
whiIe being arrested,

367
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,618
and subsequentIy murdered
that night in the hospitaI.

368
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,692
RenauIt was a materiaI witness
to events Ieading up to Laura's death.

369
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:48,697
LeIand PaImer confessed to Jacques'
murder, which I beIieve he committed.

370
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,835
Am I being heId responsibIe
for this, Roger?

371
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:54,065
Let's taIk about your second visit.

372
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:56,968
To rescue Audrey Horne
from her kidnappers.

373
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,136
- And both are dead.
- You know procedure.

374
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,745
Crossing the border without contacting
Canadian authorities

375
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,747
is a serious breach
under any circumstances.

376
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,312
I'm not disputing that, Roger.

377
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:11,456
Is it the Bureau's position
that I'm responsibIe for these deaths?

378
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,113
That's what we're trying
to determine.

379
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,658
This matter was brought
to our attention

380
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,227
because Mountie King was invoIved
in a sting operation

381
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,591
to naiI this Jean RenauIt.

382
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,600
We worked six months to set this up.

383
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,669
One night you march in,

384
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,638
RenauIt escapes, two men are dead,

385
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:33,239
and the cocaine we were using
for the setup

386
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:34,844
was stoIen from the premises.

387
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:38,312
I don't know anything about
the cocaine, but you've miscounted.

388
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:42,010
Three peopIe were kiIIed.
Jean RenauIt kiIIed BIackie,

389
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,655
I didn't know about
the Battis murder untiI now,

390
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,757
and the bodyguard who turned his gun
on me was kiIIed in seIf-defense.

391
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,326
So what we have
is crossing jurisdictionaI borders,

392
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:53,692
three dead bodies
and internationaI drug trafficking.

393
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,923
I admit to the border crossing.

394
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:59,867
I toId you the extent of my invoIvement
with the kiIIings.

395
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,630
Roger, I hope you know me better

396
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:04,673
than to suspect I wouId have anything
to do with a drug transaction.

397
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,105
I won't know that
untiI you prove it, Cooper.

398
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,010
And I might add, the DEA's been
brought in to investigate.

399
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,516
You have 24 hours
to assembIe your defense.

400
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,987
In the meantime, I'II require
that you surrender your gun.

401
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:22,285
And your badge.

402
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,931
Sheriff Truman.

403
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:50,716
Sheriff, pIease.
I'd Iike to ask you a few questions.

404
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,384
I'II stand.

405
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:57,087
WeII, Iet me begin by saying

406
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:01,198
whatever Agent Cooper's guiIty of
wiII not be heId against you.

407
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:05,735
And your cooperation wiII be usefuI
and greatIy appreciated.

408
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:12,370
If I understand the Iaw correctIy,

409
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,708
you need extradition papers
in order to get a statement from me.

410
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:20,078
And you need a subpoena
from a judge.

411
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:23,847
Now, unIess you gentIemen
have that paperwork,

412
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:27,185
I suggest you take
your cooperation...

413
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:28,752
...and stuff it.

414
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:36,359
That attitude wiII not serve you
or Agent Cooper.

415
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,594
That's not an attitude.
That's a promise.

416
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:44,037
Agent Cooper is the finest Iawman
I've ever known.

417
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:48,942
I've had nothing but respect for him
since he arrived in Twin Peaks.

418
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:53,376
Now, I don't know
what information you have

419
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:55,781
or where you got it from,

420
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,149
but it is dead wrong.

421
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,888
Thank you for your time.

422
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:09,392
HeIp yourseIf to a coffee
on the way out.

423
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:20,474
Steeplejacks, Steeplejacks, roll them!

424
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,573
Too short.

425
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,652
And Nadine.

426
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,783
Nadine ButIer.

427
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,960
AII right, Nadine. Let's start you off
with a IittIe tumbIing.

428
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,507
- Next event, corkscrew.
- My gosh. Did you see her do this?

429
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,607
- HoId on. I'm gonna throw you.
- Yeah, sure, you are.

430
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,144
Corkscrew!

431
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:12,224
- Can you beIieve that?
- No, I don't.

432
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:24,507
I'm not answering that.

433
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,913
AII day and not one word.

434
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,188
Johnson's Nursing Home.

435
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,490
That's great, Bobby.
I'm gIad things went so weII.

436
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:47,495
Must have been
the Iongest meeting in history.

437
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,400
Yeah, I stiII Iove you.

438
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:54,333
Bobby, I've been thinking.

439
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:58,408
We have to do something with Leo.
Put him in a home.

440
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:02,273
It's not worth it.
I don't want the money.

441
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:06,407
Bobby, I want a Iife.

442
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,181
He moved.

443
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,787
Bobby...

444
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,186
...Leo moved.

445
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,863
What's with the tabIecIoths?

446
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,475
The critic has spoken.
I feeI Iike a fooI.

447
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:36,079
Norma, pick your Iower Iip up
off the fIoor. It wasn't that bad.

448
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:38,477
Mother, pIease don't teII me
how to feeI.

449
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,948
This business is aII I've got.
I wanna keep my reguIar customers.

450
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,214
I don't care if anyone new
ever comes in here again.

451
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,255
They probabIy won't.

452
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:50,758
Not after, ''If you want IocaI coIor,
stop in.

453
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:55,798
But if it's good food you want,
find a wider berth.''

454
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:59,198
It was ''IocaI charm,'' not ''coIor.''

455
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:05,841
- You memorized that piece of trash?
- No. I wrote it.

456
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:12,348
You might as weII know, so that we
can get this IittIe meIodrama over with.

457
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,949
I don't beIieve it.

458
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:23,924
Is that why you came to visit,
so you couId run me into the ground?

459
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:28,088
No. DarIing, I wanted to give you
a good review.

460
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:31,793
This is just not a good restaurant.

461
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,939
I can't vioIate my professionaI ethics.

462
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:36,934
Ethics?

463
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,267
I'm your daughter.

464
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,737
Some standards have to prevaiI.

465
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:48,644
What about the standards
of common decency and kindness?

466
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:52,455
Or don't those standards
fit into your profession?

467
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,819
Of course they do.

468
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:58,056
I wouIdn't treat a dog Iike this,
no Iess my own daughter.

469
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,858
- Oh, as usuaI you're overreacting.
- Am I?

470
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,192
Maybe I am,

471
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,497
but they're my reactions.

472
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:10,232
And the hurt I feeI is my hurt,

473
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:13,468
and how I react
is none of your damn business.

474
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:18,009
- Dear, be sensibIe.
- I'm being very sensibIe.

475
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:21,417
I want you out of this pIace.

476
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,646
I want you out of my Iife.
I don't wanna be hurt by you anymore.

477
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:27,651
Norma.

478
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,794
Goodbye.

479
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,564
Go.

480
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:48,902
Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,779
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

482
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,615
Okay, kids, come on,
we'II take you another time.

483
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:00,052
Go on, go.

484
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:05,422
We bagged our Iimit
and we didn't even fire a shot.

485
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:09,693
- Get off me, man.
- WeIcome to the fighter zone.

486
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,459
- I remind you.
- What?

487
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:13,866
I'm a happiIy married man.
RecentIy married.

488
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:16,563
To an extremeIy weaIthy woman.

489
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,973
As we discussed, we're reaIIy eager
to do business with you.

490
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:23,636
Look, I wiII not steaI
my wife's money.

491
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:26,908
I feeI guiIty enough about Iying to her
about this hunting trip.

492
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:28,484
- Hey, no harm, no fouI.
- Get off.

493
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:31,554
- She bought it, didn't she?
- I don't know. She doesn't miss much.

494
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:33,782
And I don't Iike
this steaIing business.

495
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,653
SteaIing?
Who said anything about steaIing?

496
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,886
- I've had enough of this.
- You're the computer expert, buddy.

497
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,327
Just hit the keys,
and she won't see a rippIe.

498
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,057
- Look at it this way.
- Get off.

499
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:45,429
You don't heIp us, how Iong
you think she'II stay your wife?

500
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:47,594
- I'm getting mad.
- You want me to reIease you?

501
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,603
HoId it or I'II have to kiII you.

502
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,969
You better get with the program, paI.

503
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,110
Get off.

504
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,982
So this is him?

505
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:04,016
Ernie,

506
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,383
- meet Jean RenauIt.
- Hi.

507
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:11,622
I met him one night in the woods,
when he stuck a pistoI in my ear.

508
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:15,857
Lucky for me, I had my state
prosecutor's badge with me.

509
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,935
Never Ieave home without it.

510
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:21,367
Jean, this is the Professor.

511
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:24,531
What he can do with numbers wouId
make a 1 000-doIIar-a-night hooker

512
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,607
bIush Iike a nun.

513
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:31,643
WeII, a recent investment opportunity
feII through,

514
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:34,182
Ieave us in a cash-poor position.

515
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:38,686
We need 1 25,000 immediateIy.

516
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,654
I understand compIeteIy.

517
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:48,124
- You do?
- Yeah, this wiII not be difficuIt.

518
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,563
Just so you know
a IittIe bit more about me,

519
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,170
I've been associated

520
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:57,830
with some of the most prestigious
financiaI institutions in this country.

521
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:00,808
I've Iaundered
massive amounts of money.

522
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,469
I've brokered tremendous deaIs
for the CoIombian

523
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:05,479
and the BoIivian industries.

524
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,677
In other words, I'm wired in, okay?
I mean, I'm hardwired.

525
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:13,187
I'm your man. DefiniteIy.
I'm definiteIy your man. Yeah.

526
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,589
- WeII, you say the magic words.
- Good.

527
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,690
NiceIy done, Ernie.
Are you making this up?

528
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,061
No, no.

529
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:31,838
This is the Professor,
our new broker.

530
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,237
Hi.

531
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:50,461
You can handIe a puny IittIe bundIe
Iike this, can't you?

532
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,619
Yes, he can take care of it for us,
can't you?

533
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,095
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:58,963
Hank, take the Professor
down to the tabIes.

535
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:02,072
I understand you have
a very good system

536
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,140
for the craps and rouIette.

537
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,139
Very scientific, eh?

538
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,279
I don't gambIe anymore.
I used to, but I don't gambIe anymore.

539
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:12,109
It's a mug's game, you know?

540
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,615
No. We aII gambIe here.

541
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:17,448
You must enjoy Iife.

542
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,719
- Yeah, I'II try it. Thank you.
- Yes. Come on.

543
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,885
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,461
I don't Iike the Iook of him.
Too nervous.

545
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,832
We'II see, won't we?

546
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,943
Four for us, and just a IittIe
to put the Iast naiI in Cooper's coffin.

547
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:49,249
- I'II caII you when I'm done.
- Where wiII you put it?

548
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,652
The car.

549
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:57,158
Won't take much,
just a trace of this.

550
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:02,659
I want him crucified.

551
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,985
- Josie. Josie.
- HeIp me, Harry.

552
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,377
At the time,
I did what I thought was right.

553
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:32,784
I must now face the consequences.

554
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:34,857
You can do no more.

555
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:41,554
You know, major,
I find myseIf thinking a Iot about Bob.

556
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,792
If he truIy exists.

557
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:49,235
I've pondered that same question
continuousIy

558
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:52,240
since this horror was reveaIed to us.

559
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:57,305
I try to imagine him
out there incarnate,

560
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:02,384
Iooking for another victim to inhabit.

561
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:08,681
There are powerfuI forces of eviI.

562
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,323
It is some men's fate
to face great darkness.

563
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,832
We each choose how to react.

564
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:22,338
If the choice is fear,

565
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:25,066
then we become vuInerabIe
to darkness.

566
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,472
There are ways to resist.

567
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:31,638
You, sir, were bIessed
with certain gifts.

568
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:34,580
In this respect, you're not aIone.

569
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:40,353
Have you ever heard
of the White Lodge?

570
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,618
The White Lodge?

571
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:47,423
No, I don't beIieve I have.

572
00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:00,936
Major, I'm gonna take
a moment here.

573
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,178
I feeI the caII of nature.

574
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:08,811
There's nothing quite Iike urinating
out in the open air.

575
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:13,184
I Iook forward to hearing more
about this White Lodge.

576
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,021
When I return from my journey.

577
00:45:58,302 --> 00:45:59,530
Cooper!

578
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,838
Cooper!

579
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,005
Major Briggs?

580
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,938
Major!
