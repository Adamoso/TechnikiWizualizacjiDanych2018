1
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,922
Buddhist tradition first came
to the land of snow

2
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,032
in the 5th century A.D.

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,566
The first Tibetan king to be touched
by the dharma

4
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,863
was King Hathatha Rignamputsan.

5
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:07,233
He and succeeding kings
were collectively known

6
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,307
as the Happy Generations.

7
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:13,913
Now, some historians place them
in a Water Snake year, 21 3 A.D.

8
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:18,077
Others in the year of a Water Ox,
1 73 A.D.

9
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:20,446
Amazing, isn't it?
The Happy Generations.

10
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,952
Agent Cooper, l am thrilled to pieces
that the dharma came

11
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:24,556
to King Ho-Ho-Ho, l really am,

12
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,954
but l'm trying to focus
on the more immediate problems

13
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,754
of our own century here
in Twin Peaks.

14
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,823
Albert, you'd be surprised
at the connection between the two.

15
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,791
Color me amazed.

16
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:38,104
Ronette Pulaski
has woken from her coma.

17
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,772
And?

18
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,966
l'm thinking she's gonna have
quite a story to tell,

19
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:45,771
- when she regains the ability to speak.
- So she's not talking?

20
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,107
Waking but silent, probably shock.

21
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:54,018
l'm gonna show her the sketches
of Leo Johnson and Bob,

22
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,348
the man Sarah Palmer saw
in her vision.

23
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,423
The man who came to me
in my dream.

24
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,216
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth
in the last few weeks?

25
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,225
No, not yet.

26
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:07,498
Okay. l performed the autopsy
on Jacques Renault.

27
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,498
Stomach contents revealed--

28
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,035
Let's see.
--beer cans, a Maryland license plate,

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,107
half a bicycle tire, a goat
and a small wooden puppet,

30
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,868
goes by the name of Pinocchio.

31
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,669
You're making a joke.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,348
l like to think of myself
as one of the Happy Generations.

33
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,649
And by the way,
the fat boy wasn't strangled.

34
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,310
Killer snuffed him with a pillow.
He was wearing gloves,

35
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,115
tape used to bind his wrists
was stolen

36
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,155
from the hospital supply closet.
That is it.

37
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,522
lf Jacques has any secrets
he'll be taking them underground.

38
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:39,691
- What about the mill?
- Well, preliminary suggests arson.

39
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,993
l nominate Leo Johnson.

40
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,393
We'll have to get a statement
from Shelly Johnson.

41
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,038
Hospital says she's well enough.

42
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:49,968
How do you feel?

43
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,838
- Me?
- l believe it's customary to ask

44
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,505
after the health of one
recently plugged three times.

45
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:58,476
Thanks for asking.

46
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,086
- Don't get sentimental.
- Who shot me, Albert?

47
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,849
My men are interrogating
the hotel guests,

48
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,082
the usual bumper crop
of rural know-nothings

49
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,853
and drunken fly fishermen.
Nothing so far.

50
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:10,860
The world's most decrepit
room service waiter

51
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:13,499
remembers nothing out of the ordinary
about the night.

52
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,225
No surprise there.

53
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:19,098
Senor Droolcup has, shall we say,
a mind that wanders.

54
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,907
Albert, my ring is gone.

55
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,610
One day here, the next day gone.

56
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,408
So?

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,517
l'm glad you're with us, Albert.
We need the very best.

58
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,886
Dedication to duty wasn't the only thing
that brought me back here, Cooper.

59
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,328
- What else?
- Windom Earle.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,591
Agent Earle?

61
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,566
He's retired.

62
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,466
To a nice comfy chair
complete with wrist restraints

63
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,632
at the local laughing academy.

64
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:58,371
What happened?

65
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,442
Nobody knows.

66
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,917
Your former partner
flew the coop, Coop.

67
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:08,417
He escaped. Vanished into thin air.

68
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,890
That's not good.

69
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,510
Hello?

70
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,944
Mrs. Tremond? Meals on Wheels.

71
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,318
Hello?

72
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,422
Enter.

73
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,564
Mrs. Tremond?

74
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,395
Can l put your meal here?

75
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:34,870
Yes, that's fine.

76
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,014
Miss?

77
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,451
Oh, hi.

78
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,156
Sometimes things
can happen just like this:

79
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,073
Creamed corn.

80
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,975
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

81
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,546
Yes.

82
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:25,755
l requested no creamed corn.

83
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:32,520
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

84
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,797
No.

85
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,546
My grandson is studying magic.

86
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,085
That's nice.

87
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,061
Who are you?

88
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,932
l'm taking over Laura Palmer's place
on the Meals on Wheels.

89
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,572
She's dead.

90
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,070
Did you know her well?

91
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,450
No.

92
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:35,624
Okay, Mrs. Tremond.

93
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:39,925
l'll be back tomorrow to pick this up
and to bring your lunch.

94
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,467
They used to bring me
hospital food.

95
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,562
lmagine that.

96
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,943
Young lady?

97
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,508
You might ask Mr. Smith next door.

98
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,644
He was Laura's friend.

99
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:10,622
Mr. Smith does not leave his house.

100
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,426
Hello?

101
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:58,771
She seemed like a very nice girl.

102
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,592
Thanks, Harry.

103
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,335
Ronette?

104
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,294
l can't get this thing to work.

105
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,668
Excuse us, Ronette.

106
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,932
''Stop.

107
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:42,240
Read operating instructions
beneath seat before using.

108
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:50,748
Can't stand next to chair or stool.

109
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:53,686
Do not remain seated.

110
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,621
Place foot on base

111
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:59,321
and pull seat all the way up

112
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,865
until you hear a click.''

113
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,172
Sorry, Ronette.

114
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,783
Ronette,

115
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,991
can you hear me?

116
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,690
Okay.

117
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,326
l'm glad you're feeling better.

118
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:35,595
l don't want to upset you,
but we need your help.

119
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:39,703
l'm gonna show you some sketches.

120
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:43,205
We need to know
if you've seen these men before.

121
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:47,040
We need to know if these
are the men that hurt you, okay?

122
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,378
Do you recognize this man?

123
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,720
ls this the man that hurt you?

124
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,411
Ronette.

125
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,772
Train. Train.

126
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,403
- Ronette?
- Tr-- Train, train.

127
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,638
- Nurse. Right away.
- Train?

128
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,582
- Train?
- Tra--

129
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,652
Are you in the train car? Train car?

130
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:05,416
Train, train, train!

131
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Train!

132
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,654
Okay, okay. Stay calm.

133
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,990
Train, train.

134
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,300
Brother Ben,
we've got two ledgers

135
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,099
and one smoked cheese pig.

136
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,798
Which one do we burn?

137
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,705
And it ain't gonna be my pig.

138
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:36,012
The real ledger shows the mill
slowly seeking into bankruptcy,

139
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,851
masterminded by Catherine.

140
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,821
The one she faked,
for public consumption,

141
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:46,795
shows the mill
turning a healthy profit.

142
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,867
So which one do we burn?

143
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:53,496
Catherine's dead,

144
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:56,808
we put all of our money on Josie,

145
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:00,671
Catherine takes the fall for the fire,

146
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:03,474
Josie pockets the insurance money,

147
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,143
sells us the mill and the land and--
No, wait a minute.

148
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:13,084
First she has to get dear Pete
to sign on the dotted line.

149
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:17,154
Why does Pete have to sign?

150
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:22,960
Andrew's will calls for Catherine
or her heirs to approve of any sale.

151
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,332
So which one do we burn?

152
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:30,034
Once Josie sells us the mill,

153
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,838
we could get a better price
if it appears to be more profitable.

154
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,041
So we burn the real one.

155
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:37,910
On the other hand,

156
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:43,021
the real one would hold up
under any future scrutiny.

157
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:50,059
Depending upon how one looks
at the situation, it appears...

158
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,856
...they both have merit.

159
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,055
l know.

160
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,528
Maybe we should burn both of them.

161
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:03,232
lt looks like we are 1 00 percent certain
that we're not sure.

162
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,238
Jer, obviously something
requires burning.

163
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:16,018
And since we don't wanna set fire
to your smoked cheese pig,

164
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,054
why don't we...

165
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,256
...try these?

166
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,322
Marshmallows!

167
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,428
Ben, where are those hickory sticks?

168
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,022
Margaret,
it's always very nice to see you.

169
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,993
But if you're gonna spit
your sticky pitch gum out in the diner,

170
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,326
please use an ashtray,

171
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:38,503
and not the counter or the booth
like you did last time?

172
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,711
l'll have a bear claw.

173
00:17:57,223 --> 00:18:00,124
You wear shiny objects
on your chest.

174
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:03,119
Yes, l do.

175
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,163
Are you proud?

176
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:09,129
No, achievement is its own reward.
Pride obscures it.

177
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,636
Cream?

178
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,869
My log has something to tell you.

179
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,377
Do you know it?

180
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,944
l don't believe
we've been introduced.

181
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,153
l do not introduce the log.

182
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:32,419
Can you hear it?

183
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,891
No, ma'am, l cannot.

184
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:40,357
l will translate.

185
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:50,672
Deliver the message.

186
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,813
Do you understand?

187
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,876
Yes, ma'am. As a matter of fact l do.

188
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:11,957
No messages, Deputy Brennan.

189
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,962
Listen to me, Lucy Moran.
You just listen.

190
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,326
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank
was looking for donors,

191
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,059
naturally l applied.

192
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,898
lt's my civic duty,
and l like whales.

193
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:32,274
A routine physical examination
revealed that l'm sterile.

194
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,677
Sure, l thought it meant
l didn't have to take a bath,

195
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,339
but the doctors told me the truth.

196
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:41,486
They told me l can't have babies.

197
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:48,551
So, what l wanna know now is
why you're having one and how?

198
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,607
Hello, Hank.

199
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:42,744
l bet Lucy asked you
to wait outside, huh?

200
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:44,872
Might've.

201
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,987
You know,
that's an awfully cute buck, Harry.

202
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,090
Let's not waste our time.

203
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,960
Okay.

204
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,791
Why don't you...

205
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,231
...just sign in like a good boy?

206
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:06,370
Keep your nose clean
for another week.

207
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:29,658
lt's really nice to see you again.

208
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:46,534
lnteresting piece of work.

209
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:49,974
How long were you
and Hank friends?

210
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,913
We grew up together.

211
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,786
Hank used to be
a Bookhouse Boy.

212
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,853
Back then...

213
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,822
...Hank was one of the best of us.

214
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:05,492
Sheriff Truman, I have Ben Horne
on the phone for you.

215
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:07,666
Would you like me
to transfer him to you?

216
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,631
Well, not him but his phone call?

217
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,563
Put him on, Lucy.

218
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,935
Mr. Horne, this is Lucy.

219
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:24,081
I'm gonna transfer you now
into Sheriff Truman's office.

220
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,047
He's in there with
SpeciaI Agent DaIe Cooper.

221
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,550
Okay, so hold on.

222
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:39,927
Sheriff Truman,
l've transferred Ben Horne to you.

223
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,262
It's the Iine with the Iight
that's bIinking.

224
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:47,597
- Yes, Ben.
- Harry...

225
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:49,998
...Audrey's missing.

226
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:53,975
- What?
- For as much as maybe two days.

227
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,373
You hold on.

228
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,413
Audrey Horne is missing.

229
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:16,057
One insurance policy, unsigned.

230
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,858
''Un''?

231
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,767
The agent said that Catherine
was concerned

232
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,067
about certain irregularities.

233
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:28,873
Such as Josie being named
the chief beneficiary.

234
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,106
Agent wasn't supposed
to show it to her.

235
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:35,447
Well, considering
Catherine's smoky fate,

236
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:38,522
for our side, it's all for the best.

237
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:44,625
Well. Win a few, lose a few.

238
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:49,325
Let's get those pickled icemen
on the blower.

239
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:56,436
Gentlemen,
l've been giving this a lot of thought.

240
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:59,475
This mill fire will put contract signing
on hold for the moment,

241
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,977
so we must ensure that the moment,
our moment, does not pass us by.

242
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:04,809
l therefore recommend
we make a quick

243
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,746
but cordial follow-up phone call
to lceland,

244
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:07,976
a little gentle handling,

245
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,587
let Einer know
that we're right on top of this thing.

246
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:13,256
We can handle that.

247
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,856
Ben Horne for Einer Thorson.

248
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,487
Now, this is a coincidence.

249
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,568
Einer.

250
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,499
What's that?

251
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,274
Where did you hear about it?

252
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:37,946
Mr. Palmer called
to tell you about the fire?

253
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,946
No, no, l wouldn't call it
a disaster at all.

254
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,785
lt's just one of those things,
an unfortunate development.

255
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,154
But l assure you, Einer,

256
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:52,729
that it in no way
will affect our development plans.

257
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,899
Jerry Horne here, Einer.

258
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,862
Full speed ahead.

259
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,468
Yes, yes, of course, Einer.

260
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,837
We will fax all pertinent details
to you.

261
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,136
Yes, yes, l promise.

262
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:10,714
Listen, l don't want you to worry
your attractive blond head about this.

263
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,113
Einer, l'm in a meeting, gotta go.

264
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,012
Leland?

265
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:21,553
Leland, here's an idea.

266
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,024
Let's take you off of
damage control,

267
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:27,222
let you concentrate on something
that you can handle.

268
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,867
Like my tax return.

269
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,740
l know him.

270
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:39,700
Excuse me?

271
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:47,150
My grandfather's summer house
on Pearl Lakes.

272
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,881
He lived right next door.

273
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,454
l was just a little boy.

274
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,656
But l know him.

275
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,399
l've gotta tell the sheriff
about this right away.

276
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:08,766
Jerry...

277
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:11,973
...please kill Leland.

278
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,376
ls this real, Ben,

279
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:22,282
or some strange and
twisted dream?

280
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:28,684
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine--

281
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:31,158
lt's all right, Shelly, come on.

282
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,063
The bullet lodged in his spine,
but we removed it successfully.

283
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:40,227
As for possible paralysis,
it's too early to tell.

284
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:41,838
Leo lost a lot of blood,

285
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,804
most of it before we had a chance
to operate.

286
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:48,913
l fear the resulting oxygen deprivation
starved his brain,

287
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,813
induced the coma you see here.

288
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,715
ls he a vegetable?

289
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:58,783
ls he in pain?

290
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:00,788
He's not in pain.

291
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,450
Beyond that, it's hard to say.

292
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,523
Can you make him better?

293
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,596
We can maintain his current state.

294
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,295
Offer nutrition, life-support.

295
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:18,239
Beyond that the only ally
we have is time.

296
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,171
l'm sorry, Shelly.

297
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:23,471
Me too.

298
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,940
Are they gonna put him in prison?

299
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,615
l know he's a suspect
in several felonies.

300
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,390
l guess at the moment
he's kind of in prison anyway.

301
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,790
Yes, he is.

302
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:55,045
Come on, l'll take you back
to your room.

303
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:00,682
Norma's waiting downstairs
to drive you home.

304
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:16,065
Hello, Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.

305
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,199
Who may l say is calling, please?

306
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:23,337
l'm sorry, l can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

307
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,341
unless you tell me
what your name is.

308
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:29,075
You won't?

309
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:33,276
l'm sorry, but l can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

310
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:36,250
unless you tell me who you are.

311
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,122
l'm terribly sorry,
but l'm going to have to hang up now.

312
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:05,743
Hey, l'll take it from here.

313
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,646
No. No, you won't.

314
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:09,753
No, it's okay.

315
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:13,452
Okay, but watch out for this one.

316
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,149
Okay.

317
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,608
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?

318
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:06,903
Look at those toes.

319
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:08,977
What toes?

320
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,441
l brought the ice.

321
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,279
Frosty? My little snowman.

322
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:19,219
l feel a cold front moving in.

323
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:24,428
Hi, Emory.
You remember me?

324
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:28,664
lt really looks like you got yourself
in a fix here, huh?

325
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:29,857
Well, guess what.

326
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,865
l'm going to tell you a nice
little bedtime story. Are you ready?

327
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:37,297
Once upon a time there was
a sweet, innocent girl named Red--

328
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,499
That's me.

329
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:41,646
--and she met a bad old wolf--
That's you.

330
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:46,011
--and she kicked the crap out of that
wolf and she told her daddy all about it.

331
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:47,242
Then she told the police,

332
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,250
and the bad old wolf
went to jail for a million years.

333
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,252
- What do you want?
- l want to know everything you know.

334
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:57,189
Perfume counter, Laura Palmer,
Ronette Pulaski and One-Eyed Jack's.

335
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,453
You're insane.

336
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,426
l'm insane?

337
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,433
Well, l'm Audrey Horne
and l get what l want.

338
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,571
- Understand?
- Yes, all right.

339
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,870
l work for the owner
of One-Eyed Jack's.

340
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,066
- Who is?
- l work for the owner

341
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:14,610
- of One-Eyed Jack's.
- Who is?

342
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:15,870
Your father.

343
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,908
He owns it all.
Hell, he owns everything.

344
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,051
l run girls through
the perfume counter.

345
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,187
l recruited Ronette and Laura.

346
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:26,214
- Did Laura come here?
- One weekend.

347
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,619
She was using drugs.

348
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,057
We threw her out.
l never saw her again, l swear.

349
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,060
Did my father know
that Laura was here?

350
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,755
Yes, yes, he did.

351
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:39,400
Mr. Horne makes it his business
to entertain all the girls.

352
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,568
Did she know he owned this place?

353
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:43,799
Owned what?

354
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,809
- One-Eyed Jack's!
- Yes! Yes. Probably she did.

355
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,875
Laura always got her way.

356
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,073
Understand?

357
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:55,452
Just like you.

358
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,603
Why don't you change the station.

359
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,764
That's good.

360
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:20,301
Yeah.

361
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:24,979
l made the call.

362
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,118
Told them l was Leo's cousin.

363
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:28,980
Leo gets his disability

364
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:32,612
as long as he stays out of prison.
lt's a lot of money, Shelly.

365
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:34,655
Over 5,000 a month.

366
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:38,353
But you only get it
if he stays at home.

367
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,991
l don't care about the money.
l don't want Leo home.

368
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,032
Leo is in dreamland.

369
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:50,163
You can stick him in the corner
and hang doughnuts from his ears.

370
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,640
Sheriff Truman wants me
to make a statement.

371
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:56,644
No way. Look, they can't force you
to testify against your husband.

372
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,181
All you gotta do is get Leo home,

373
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:02,081
sit and collect the checks.

374
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,624
Leo owes you, baby.

375
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,850
Now we can really make him pay.

376
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:11,619
You want something nice?
We can buy it.

377
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:15,459
You want to go someplace special,
sit in the sun?

378
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,601
lt's on Leo. Understand?

379
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:27,008
l guess it would be nice
not to have to worry about money.

380
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,503
l have a lot of bills l have to pay.

381
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:34,983
Bills? Forget about bills.
l'm talking about a new way of life.

382
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,654
Together?

383
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,033
What do you think?

384
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:59,939
l think l wanna get comfortable.

385
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:03,441
That's why l got my dad's Continental.

386
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:13,647
Bobby Briggs,
l'm gonna eat you up.

387
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:16,155
Promise?

388
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,856
Just watch me.

389
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:30,065
Diane, l received
some very bad news today.

390
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:33,740
Windom Earle has vanished.

391
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,606
The disappearance
of my former partner

392
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:39,477
is extremely troubling.

393
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:44,051
l also learned that Audrey Horne
is missing.

394
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:49,716
Audrey's absence touches me
in ways l could not predict.

395
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:53,295
l find myself thinking not of clues
or of evidence,

396
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,434
but of the content of her smile.

397
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,967
Who is it?

398
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:05,108
lt's Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.

399
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,513
Just a moment.

400
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:23,119
- Major.
- May l come in?

401
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:24,761
Please.

402
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:34,997
l have a message for you.

403
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,868
From whom?

404
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:41,608
l'm not at liberty
to reveal the nature of my work.

405
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,714
This secrecy pains me
from time to time.

406
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:47,784
Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret

407
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:51,319
inevitably lends itself to corruption.

408
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:54,789
But these rules l have pledged
to uphold.

409
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,449
l believe a pledge is sacred.

410
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,386
Speaking as a man

411
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,293
and a fellow employee
of the federal government, so do l.

412
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,195
Well, l may reveal this much:

413
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,234
Among my many tasks

414
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,532
is the maintenance
of deep-space monitors

415
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:12,369
aimed at galaxies beyond our own.

416
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:17,972
We routinely receive
various communications,

417
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:21,516
space garbage,
to decode and examine.

418
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,018
They look something like this.

419
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:30,894
lt's radio waves and gibberish,
Agent Cooper.

420
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,564
Till Thursday night.

421
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:36,791
Friday morning to be exact.

422
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:39,999
Around the time that l was shot.

423
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:45,498
The readout took us by surprise.

424
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,168
Row after row of gibberish.

425
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:50,405
And all of a sudden...

426
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:54,912
''The owls are not what they seem.''

427
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:04,892
Why did you bring this to me?

428
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,063
Because later in the morning...

429
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:11,861
''Cooper...

430
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,097
...Cooper. Cooper.''

431
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,040
My God.

432
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:30,150
That was really good.
Let's try it again.

433
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:55,103
Just you and I

434
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:03,185
Just you and I

435
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:07,591
Together

436
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:12,324
Forever

437
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,792
In Iove

438
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,396
Just you

439
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,438
Just you

440
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:28,340
- And I
- And I

441
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:32,607
- Just you
- Just you

442
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,945
And I

443
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,519
- And I
- And I

444
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,658
- Together
- Together

445
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:45,694
- Forever
- Forever

446
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,026
- In Iove
- In Iove

447
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,195
In Iove

448
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,809
- In Iove
- In Iove

449
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:04,972
We go stroIIing together

450
00:40:10,354 --> 00:40:13,983
In Iove

451
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:22,958
We go stroIIing forever

452
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:31,270
- Just you
- Just you

453
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:35,572
- And I
- And I

454
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,185
Just you and I

455
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:43,980
And I

456
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:48,284
Together

457
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,927
Forever

458
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:57,024
In Iove

459
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:06,204
Just you

460
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,312
And I

461
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,440
Just you

462
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:18,548
And I

463
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:23,052
Just you

464
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:26,219
And I

465
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:30,097
Just you

466
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,466
And I

467
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,900
Just you

468
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:43,079
Donna.

469
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:45,776
Donna, what's wrong?

470
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,645
Nothing.

471
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:52,316
Donna?

472
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:53,647
Donna, what's going on?

473
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,986
l'm trembling, James.

474
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,094
You made me.

475
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,089
Donna.

476
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,159
Donna?

477
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:08,699
Yes?

478
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:13,276
There's a telephone call for you
from a Harold Smith.

479
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,606
Oh, okay. l'll get it in the hallway.

480
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,651
Okay, Dad. l got it.

481
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:33,092
Okay, sweetheart.

482
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:36,656
Hello?

483
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:40,033
Mr. Smith?

484
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,204
l received yours.

485
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,976
l wanted to talk to you.

486
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,408
We can meet?

487
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,050
Okay.

488
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:25,637
The owls are not what they seem.

489
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:35,813
The owls are not what they seem.

490
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:49,261
Laura!

491
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:53,462
Laura!

492
