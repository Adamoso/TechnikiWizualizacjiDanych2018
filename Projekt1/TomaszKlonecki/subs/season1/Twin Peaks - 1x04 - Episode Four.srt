1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:02,721
Previously on "Twin Peaks"...

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:06,323
Agent Cooper. There's no sign
of the man with one arm.

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,205
Keep trying. He's out there.

4
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,358
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

5
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,006
- He's a tracker?
- The best.

6
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,919
My darling daughter Jade.

7
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,886
Uncle Leland?

8
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:18,761
Madeleine?

9
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:31,355
Blood?

10
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,876
Somebody's running drugs
into Twin Peaks.

11
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:35,844
- Who's targeted?
- Jacques Renault.

12
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,600
Bartender at the Roadhouse.
We figure him for the middleman.

13
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:42,003
- Who's this?
- Bernard Renault. Jacques' brother.

14
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,924
Did you sell drugs to Laura Palmer?

15
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:45,684
Yeah. Yeah, his hair was long.

16
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:49,157
Filthy, grey on grey, long hair.

17
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:07,118
I saw him. At the foot of Laura's bed.

18
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,084
He looked like an animal.

19
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:12,882
- Had you seen this man before?
- No. Never.

20
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:16,397
His face. My God, his face!

21
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:20,606
Sarah, did you tell them
about the necklace?

22
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,486
- They're gonna love that one.
- What necklace?

23
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,558
She's had two visions.

24
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,843
Go ahead, Sarah.

25
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,523
Leland.

26
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,279
Leland.

27
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,320
Sarah.

28
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,676
It's night.

29
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:45,561
A flashlight beam
moves across the ground.

30
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:51,006
Then a hand, a gloved hand,

31
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:56,366
lifts a rock and takes out a necklace,

32
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,445
broken in half.

33
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,882
It was Laura's.

34
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:06,278
Invitation to love.

35
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:14,003
Don't fight it, Chet.

36
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,762
You know as well as I
there's still something betweenus.

37
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:20,845
There always will be.

38
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,243
For God's sake, Emerald.
That may be true, but...

39
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,843
I'm married to your sister now.
It's wrong.

40
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,044
You always said
you could never tellus apart, so...

41
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,277
Morning, Lucy. What's going on?

42
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,803
Thanks to Jade,
Jared decided not to kill himself

43
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,765
and he's leaving the Towers
to Jade instead of Emerald.

44
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:45,166
Emerald knows, and is now seducing
Chet for the will so she can destroy it.

45
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,644
Montana plans to kill Jared so the
Towers will belong to Emerald and him.

46
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:53,117
I think she's gonna double-cross him,
and he doesn't know it yet.

47
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,640
Poor Chet.

48
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,997
What's going on here?

49
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,597
Agent Cooper's in the conference room
with Dr Jacoby.

50
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,843
Thank you.

51
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,841
Lucy, why couldn't I
spend the night last night?

52
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:10,243
Will you be having coffee,
Deputy Brennan?

53
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:28,526
Was Laura Palmer seeing you
because she was addicted to cocaine?

54
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:33,966
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help you,
but I got a little problem here.

55
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,244
Maybe there's
some sort of hula we can do

56
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,638
around my doctor-patient
confidentiality?

57
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,918
She came to you
because she was having problems?

58
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,043
Oh, my, yes.

59
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,317
Were her problems
of a sexual nature?

60
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,079
Agent Cooper.

61
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:55,597
The problems of our entire society
are of a sexual nature.

62
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,159
Tibet.

63
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,004
You know, my abiding interests
lie to the east, as well.

64
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,766
But only as far as Hawaii.

65
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:12,600
The ancient Hawaiians often turned to
the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant

66
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:15,764
to ease the pain
of profound confusion, which,

67
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,526
more often than not, was sexual.

68
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:22,119
Ginger is nonaddictive, cocaine is.

69
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:25,802
The fact that Laura Palmer
sought medication,

70
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,357
no matter how dubious,
was actually a positive sign.

71
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:32,399
Doctor Jacoby, lunderstand
you cared deeply for Laura Palmer.

72
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,444
Why won't you help us?

73
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:40,886
My own personal investigation,
I suspect,

74
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,357
will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

75
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:49,797
Laura had secrets.

76
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:54,796
And around those secrets
she built the fortress,

77
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:59,364
well, that in my six months with her,
I was not able to penetrate,

78
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:03,440
and for which I consider myself
an abject failure.

79
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:09,403
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby
Briggs or James Hurley with you?

80
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,405
They were boys, Laura was a woman.

81
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,798
She had sex with three men
the night she was murdered.

82
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,083
Were you one of them?

83
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:20,436
No.

84
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:23,001
Who killed her, Doctor Jacoby?

85
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,402
The night after Laura died

86
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:30,197
I followed a man
that Laura had spoken to me about.

87
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,636
He was driving a red Corvette.

88
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:36,800
I followed him to the Old Sawmill
Road, and then I lost him.

89
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,157
And that, gentlemen,
is all I can tell you.

90
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:43,797
Agent Cooper, a Gordon Cole
says you're expecting his call.

91
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:47,562
- Should I put him through?
- Yes, Lucy, put him through.

92
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,445
Thank you, Doctor. That's all.

93
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:54,038
You'll be in town, Doctor?

94
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage
to Pebble Beach,

95
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,000
but that's not till the end of the month.

96
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,601
Hang loose, haoles.

97
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,639
- Leo Johnson drives a red Corvette?
- Yes.

98
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,038
- How we doing on Jacques Renault?
- There's an APB on him.

99
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:14,041
His brother made bail this morning.
I got an "All Points" on him, too.

100
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,721
Harry, this is my supervisor.

101
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:21,525
- Morning, Gordon. How are we doing?
- Where do we start?

102
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:25,680
The Palmer girl or Albert's
new best friend, Harry Truman?

103
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,441
- Laura Palmer.
- Albert has been very busy.

104
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,077
The twine he found on her upper arm
is a common household variety:

105
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:33,885
Finley's Fine Twine.

106
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,006
- And the twine on her wrists?
- Definitely not a match. No ID yet.

107
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:41,597
And those marks
on her shoulders, bird bites.

108
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,601
He'll also fax a reconstruction of the
plastic fragment from her stomach.

109
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,195
Great. We're anxiously
awaiting his results.

110
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,366
Now for the bad news, Coop. I've got
an OOJ and an AFO from Albert

111
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,519
concerning his "mano a mano"
with the local sheriff, Truman.

112
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,678
Albert wants this guy's badge, Coop.

113
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:01,681
Gordon, here's how it is.
You know Albert.

114
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:05,999
Sheriff Truman displayed a saint's
patience not clocking him before.

115
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:10,006
- He wants it filed with the US Attorney.
- File it under Ffor forget it.

116
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:14,006
Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this,
I'll fight him all the way to Washington!

117
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:16,402
- Don't get ex cited...
- Later, Gordon.

118
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,006
Thanks. I didn't get
a whole lot of sleep last night.

119
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,237
The last thing
I want you to worry about

120
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:30,157
is some city slicker I brought into
your town relieving himself upstream.

121
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,719
- This is the man I saw in my dream.
- You saw this man?

122
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,800
I had an intuition that my dream and
Sarah Palmer's vision were connected.

123
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:43,597
I didn't go because I didn't wanna
influence her. I'm a strong sender.

124
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:48,403
- The eyes were closer together.
- Deputy Hawk for Agent Cooper.

125
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,965
Hawk.

126
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,322
Right. Stay there.

127
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,364
Follow him if he moves.

128
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,796
Travelling east on Highway 12,
how long is it to the Timber Falls Motel?

129
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,202
- 10 minutes.
- Half an hour. Depends how you go.

130
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:06,080
Hawk's found our one-armed man.

131
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:20,925
I wish I could've seen Josie's face,
opening the safe for her lawman Romeo

132
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,396
to show him the double set of books.

133
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,917
And all she finds
is the one I've been slowly cooking.

134
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:29,601
Where's the book
that spells bankruptcy?

135
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,878
I have more than one hiding place.

136
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,718
My desk upstairs.

137
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:40,000
There's a drop panel
on the top drawer.

138
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:43,842
Not even Pete the poodle
knows about that one.

139
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,805
I'm famished.

140
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:57,402
I suppose room service
is too much to expect

141
00:10:57,527 --> 00:11:00,246
of this rusticated mildewfarm.

142
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:05,037
You would prefer the Lumber Baron
Suite at the Great Northern.

143
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,756
I'd prefer getting on with setting
the torch to that damn mill.

144
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,885
Harry, he's here at the motel.

145
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:20,481
Room 101. Last name is Gerard.

146
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:26,204
Now, when the mill goes up in smoke,
the headline we're after is,

147
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:30,798
"Josie Packard torches
bankrupt mill in insurance fraud",

148
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:36,240
not "Giant weenie roast in the woods".

149
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:48,963
Mr Gerard, it's the police. Open up!

150
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,281
What? Jeez!

151
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,479
Gunplay. Sounds serious.

152
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,878
Mr Gerard!

153
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:06,838
- Don't move.
- Oh, my God!

154
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:10,238
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

155
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:21,083
You let me know
if there's any bloodshed.

156
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:25,081
I'm going to give little Elvis a bath.

157
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:44,484
You know this man.

158
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,356
No, sir. I've never seen
that man before in my life.

159
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,564
But, you know,
he kind of looks like somebody.

160
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,036
Mr Gerard,
do you have a friend named Bob?

161
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,482
Bob Lydecker is my best friend.

162
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:59,405
- Why have you been at the hospital?
- Bob's in a coma.

163
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:04,396
A Lydecker was assaulted three
days ago outside a bar in Lotown.

164
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:07,564
- That's Bob.
- Is your friend Bob a doctor?

165
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,287
He's the best darn veterinarian
in these parts.

166
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,722
Thanks.

167
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:15,685
He's clean: no record, no warrants.

168
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,325
Take a look at his car.

169
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,399
- Your middle name is Michael.
- Named after my uncle.

170
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,758
- How did you lose the arm?
- Car accident.

171
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:29,806
I was on the road
from Memphis to someplace.

172
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,637
Selling pharmaceuticals.
A pretty good job.

173
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,764
That's what I'm selling these days.
Everybody needs shoes.

174
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:43,237
- They're all for the right foot.
- It's my sample case.

175
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,801
Two-day delivery guaranteed.

176
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:48,919
We could certainly take care of
all your departmental needs.

177
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,238
The arm you lost,
did it have a tattoo?

178
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,801
What's this all about?

179
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,640
- I'm a shoe salesman.
- Settle down, Mr Gerard.

180
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:01,925
- He asked you a question.
- If you won't tell us, we can find out.

181
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,521
What did it say?

182
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:08,797
It said...

183
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:12,241
"Mom"!

184
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:20,596
Harry.

185
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:26,558
- What you got?
- Car was staked out when I got here.

186
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,200
It was Josie Packard.

187
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,396
I've been doing some research.

188
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,319
In real life, there is no algebra.

189
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,002
Maybe you should run away
and join the circus.

190
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:00,040
Escape!
I've got a better idea.

191
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:05,403
A tall, dark and handsome stranger
falls madly in love with me

192
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:10,237
and takes me away to a life of mystery
and international intrigue.

193
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:14,195
You mean the FBI agent?
Dream on.

194
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,283
Maybe.

195
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,000
Maybe he'll realise
I'm the woman of his dreams,

196
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,678
because I'm gonna help him
figure out who killed Laura.

197
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,803
And you're gonna help me.

198
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,562
Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley
behind Bobby's back.

199
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:35,164
- What if she was?
- So it is true.

200
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,484
Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth
for nose candy.

201
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,603
I guess it's not such a big secret.

202
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:46,000
I didn't know Laura half as well as you,
and I knew the score. Laura was wild.

203
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,922
Come on, will you help me?

204
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,718
What else have you figured out,
Sherlock?

205
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,878
The morning of the funeral,

206
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:59,801
Dr Jacoby is trying to get
my brother Johnny to go the funeral.

207
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,999
He tells Johnny that Laura's
in a better place now, blah, blah,

208
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:08,360
and he knows that,
because Laura was his patient.

209
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,966
- Laura was seeing Jacoby?
- It gets better.

210
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:19,086
- Ever heard of One-Eyed Jacks?
- That western with Marlon Brando?

211
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,806
It's a place across the border.
They have girls working there.

212
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,077
You think Laura was one of them?

213
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:29,398
I don't know. If it's true,
wouldn't you wanna know?

214
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,558
It would explain a few things.

215
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,639
You know, I think about Laura
being in a place like that,

216
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,440
and I get all shivery.
But it's like a hot cold.

217
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:45,397
Like when you hold an ice cube
on your bare skin for a long time.

218
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:51,796
I'll help you. But whatever we find out,
we have to promise to keep it a secret.

219
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,242
It's a deal. I know where to start.

220
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:58,042
Did you know Ronnette and Laura
worked in the same place?

221
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:02,883
The perfume counter
at my father's department store.

222
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:22,358
Have a chat with Hank before
the hearing. He's glad you're here.

223
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:25,200
I hope I didn't come on
too strong yesterday.

224
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:29,479
I'll be sure to tell him how helpful
you've been, Mr Mooney.

225
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:53,046
Haven't seen you for a while, Norma.

226
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,926
- I've been kind of busy.
- So...

227
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,159
- Business is good?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,804
You gotta back me up
in there, Norma, please.

229
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,317
I gotta get out. It's starting
to put the zap on me big time.

230
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:13,798
I know I have no right to ask
and you have no reason to believe me,

231
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,316
but I'll change.

232
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:20,717
I swear on my life,
I have changed.

233
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:26,237
Give me a chance
to prove it to you.

234
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:30,764
I've replayed it in my mind a million
times, and I don't have any answers.

235
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,600
A car in perfect condition
goes out of control.

236
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:38,403
A vagrant nobody knows is killed
while sleeping by the roadside.

237
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,087
Why did fate deal me this hand?

238
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,846
You are not incarcerated
for an act of fate, Mr Jennings.

239
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,885
I accept that, but it was fate,

240
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:51,086
maybe even luck, that sent me to jail,
just as much as the car accident.

241
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:56,602
- What is your point?
- I know I have a lot to makeup for.

242
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:59,440
For the life I destroyed

243
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:04,522
and for another life
I very nearly destroyed.

244
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:08,560
Mrs Jennings, your husband would be
facing a difficult re-entry...

245
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:13,681
- how would you help him?
- I own a diner in Twin Peaks.

246
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,883
I can give him a job.

247
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,244
The boss is tough, but fair.

248
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,916
And you would live together
as man and wife?

249
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:26,247
Well, he is my husband, isn't he?

250
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,163
We have what we need here.

251
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,558
We'll make our decision
without the inmate present.

252
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:37,044
We'll let you know
by five o'clock today.

253
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,677
Catch you later.

254
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:08,918
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob
lived above a convenience store.

255
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,842
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid
to go to sleep at night.

256
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,922
Hey, Hawk.

257
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:29,684
Andy, could you go into the One Stop
and get me some twine?

258
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,395
No, that's not Doctor Lydecker.

259
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:51,196
- Does Doctor Lydecker treat birds?
- Well, yes, of course.

260
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:56,043
You know, there are
plenty other vets in Twin Peaks.

261
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:58,596
Only one has
a best friend with one arm.

262
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:03,084
Harry, in the heat
of the investigative pursuit,

263
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:06,762
the shortest distance between two
points is not necessarily a straight line.

264
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:10,840
Andy. Hand me that spool
of Finley's Fine Twine.

265
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:14,396
Miss Loomer,
we're confiscating your files.

266
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,846
What?

267
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,918
As clear as the signs on the turnpike,

268
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:22,126
the bird that attacked Laura Palmer
is a client of this office.

269
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,682
I feel so bad for you.

270
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:41,846
I was watching you at the funeral,
and my heart was aching.

271
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,999
I wanted to hold you so much.

272
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,237
That James Hurley.

273
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,806
He was seeing Laura
behind my back.

274
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,803
I'm gonna fix him.

275
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,282
Fix me first.

276
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:05,283
When is Leo due back?

277
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,397
Don't worry, bad boy.

278
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,246
I can hear his 'Vette a mile away.

279
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,757
Don't mess around with this, Shelly.
Where is he?

280
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:20,718
He's with his friend,
that creepy Jacques.

281
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:26,160
Jacques, who?

282
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,566
That Canuck guy
that works at the Roadhouse.

283
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,046
Leo and Jacques?

284
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:33,118
What's the matter?

285
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,326
Gotta think. I gotta think.

286
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:44,237
Well, think later, Bobby. I have
to go back to the diner in half an hour.

287
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,243
I gotta tell you something.

288
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,319
What is it?

289
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,923
I've been on to this for a while,
checking it out. It's pretty bad.

290
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,123
Tell me.

291
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:59,565
Leo and Jacques are running drugs
across the border. Cocaine.

292
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:03,037
They've been selling them at school.

293
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,641
I knew Leo was messed up
in something.

294
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:09,277
I think it's even possible
they were giving drugs to Laura.

295
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:12,041
Bobby, I have to show you something.

296
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:21,596
This was in Leo's truck
two days after Laura was murdered.

297
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:24,241
Are you sure this is Leo's?

298
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,967
It has his initials on the collar.

299
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,641
He makes me sew them
into everything.

300
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:37,397
Shelly, this could be
the answer to our prayers.

301
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:40,755
What do you mean?

302
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:46,604
You don't need to know.
I'm gonna take this, OK?

303
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:50,077
You never saw this. Say it,

304
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:54,959
- "I never saw it."
- I never saw it.

305
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,201
Leo's not gonna be
a problem for us any more.

306
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:01,524
Stay clear of him and keep quiet.

307
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,478
I bought this.

308
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:11,326
You know how to use it?

309
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,166
I thought you could teach me.

310
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,887
Teach me, Bobby.

311
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,083
Take them into the conference room.

312
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:31,479
Lucy, go through these files and
pull out the people who own birds.

313
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:36,006
- How will I know they own birds?
- lt'll say so on the cards.

314
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,764
OK, I'll start going through
the files, then.

315
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:49,284
Agent Cooper, I'm so sorry.
My gun just slipped out of my hand.

316
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,677
Ever used your weapon
in the line of duty?

317
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,443
No, sir. I can't explain what happened.
I've been feeling a little high-strung.

318
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:59,246
Lack of preparation.
We'll take care of that.

319
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:04,196
Andy, get ammunition from the lockbox.
Meet us downstairs at the pistol range.

320
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,362
Lucy, did you hear what happened?
I feel so dumb.

321
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:15,882
I dropped my gun, and it went off.

322
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,039
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah. I guess so, but...

323
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:22,404
I'd like to chat, but I am under orders
to examine these files,

324
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,206
so if you'll excuse me, please.

325
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:31,521
Laura Palmer's murder
was vicious and calculated.

326
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:34,406
No telling what we'll encounter
bringing a suspect to ground.

327
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,802
After Andy's mishap,
I wanna make certain

328
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:38,997
we're comfortable with our firearms.

329
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,355
Nice piece.

330
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:43,599
Actually, it's standard issue;
I made a few modifications.

331
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:46,639
How long has Lucy
Been upset with Andy?

332
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:50,004
- Body language?
- It was yelling through a megaphone.

333
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,364
- Six rounds a piece to start with, Andy.
- OK.

334
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:57,118
Care to tell us
about you and Lucy, Andy?

335
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:00,802
- Jeez, you can tell?
- Not many secrets left around here.

336
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,605
She won't speak to me,
and I don't know why.

337
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:09,596
And I don't know why she's doing what
she's doing. I just can't figure her out.

338
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:12,560
There's no logic at work here, Andy.

339
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:16,003
In the grand design, women were
drawn from a different set of blueprints.

340
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,442
- Amen to that.
- Amen.

341
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:20,962
Hawk, Andy.

342
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,440
Rapid fire.

343
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:43,239
Hawk: six for six, two kills,
high marks. Andy...

344
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,760
Andy, what we need
is practice and lots of it.

345
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,799
One hour, three times a week.
Harry, supply the ordnance?

346
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,083
Whatever it takes.

347
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,363
Chin up, Andy.

348
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:59,595
- You ever been married, Cooper?
- No.

349
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:04,526
I knew someone once who helped me
understand commitment,

350
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:08,043
the responsibilities and the risks...

351
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,166
...who taught me
the pain of a broken heart.

352
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,757
One woman can make you fly
like an eagle.

353
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,885
Another can give you
the strength of a lion.

354
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:35,881
But only one in the cycle of life
can fill your heart with wonder

355
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:39,403
and the wisdom
that you have known a singular joy.

356
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:43,403
- I wrote that for my girlfriend.
- Local gal?

357
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:46,837
Diane Shapiro, PhD, Brandeis.

358
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:54,198
Harry: one miss, five hits,
three kills. Excellent.

359
00:27:58,087 --> 00:27:59,759
Only four hits?

360
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:03,636
I put four through the eyes
and one through each nostril.

361
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,998
Agent Cooper, I'm looking
at the files from Lydecker's.

362
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:12,042
I have hereunder A's an Arky,
who's a part poodle, part Rottweiler,

363
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,323
who lives on Maple
and belongs to Mr Rumple.

364
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:18,526
I have an Annette, an otter who
lives with a family near Oak River.

365
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,757
We wanted the name of birds.

366
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,447
I know, but the files
are organised alphabetically.

367
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:27,282
- Lucy, go through the bird file.
- You don't understand.

368
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:31,235
They're organised alphabetically
under the names of the pet.

369
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,080
We're gonna need some more coffee.

370
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:51,797
Thanks, Toad. I'll be sure to get this
into my retirement fund asap.

371
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,555
Shelly, you're gonna scare
the customers.

372
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:04,438
I've got one man too many in my life,
and I'm married to him. Sound familiar?

373
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:07,405
Maybe you should have
a little talk with Leo.

374
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:10,283
Leo doesn't talk.

375
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,918
He hits.

376
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:19,800
He was so great at first, you know?
This flashy guy in his hot car.

377
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,316
Then we get married, and I find out

378
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:25,399
all he was looking for was a maid
he didn't have to pay.

379
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,596
I feel so stupid.

380
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:32,483
Look atus.

381
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:39,401
Two men apiece and we don't know
what to do with any of the four of them.

382
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:43,560
- So how did Hank's hearing go?
- No decision till this afternoon.

383
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:46,963
Have you told him
you're divorcing him for Ed?

384
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:53,122
When I saw him, I...
He might not even get out this time.

385
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:56,563
I guess my plans
are a little up in the air.

386
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah, well,
I've definitely got plans for Leo.

387
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:13,605
You know what were gonna do, Shelly,
tomorrow? We'll have a day of beauty.

388
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:17,442
A manicure, a facial, we're gonna have
our hair done, the works.

389
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,805
We're gonna be the knockouts
of the RR. It's my treat.

390
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:23,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,125
- Donna?
- Hi, James.

392
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,084
- Donna.
- Hold on.

393
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,442
Who the heck
ever heard of diet lasagne?

394
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:33,236
Just a sec, Daddy,
I'll be right in, OK? It's James.

395
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,801
We're having this church
potluck dinner tonight.

396
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,995
Tell him to get over here.
I need help. SOS. Mayday.

397
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:44,318
- Would you like to come?
- I wouldn't be good company.

398
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:48,321
I think we need to talk.

399
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:50,364
I found out some things.

400
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:53,405
Audrey told me some stuff,
and Mrs Palmer saw something.

401
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,246
- What?
- If you come over, I could tell you.

402
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,642
I'll get something to eat,
and I'll be over.

403
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,162
OK. Bye.

404
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,123
Hi.

405
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,240
Who are you?

406
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:19,358
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.
Laura was my cousin.

407
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,440
James Hurley.

408
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:26,003
Laura and I hadn't seen
each other much recently.

409
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:29,483
I live in Missoula.
Did you know Laura well?

410
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:31,399
I thought I did.

411
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:35,401
- Here you go. Your order's ready.
- Thanks a lot.

412
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,998
I'm picking up food
for my aunt and uncle.

413
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:42,243
Aunt Sarah can't cook right now,

414
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:46,406
and Uncle Leland is up half the night
listening to old music and crying.

415
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:50,196
But if I was cooking for them,
they'd be even worse.

416
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:56,122
- You think I look like Laura?
- Yes.

417
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:59,199
We used to visit Twin Peaks
when I was a kid.

418
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:02,603
It was great.
We'd pretend we were sisters.

419
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,917
I wish I'd known her better.

420
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,677
It's so sad.

421
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:14,762
Well, it was nice to meet you,
James Hurley.

422
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,804
Nice to meet you, too.

423
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,446
Thanks for calling, Mr Mooney.

424
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,998
Are you OK?

425
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:42,721
Hank got his parole.

426
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,163
He's coming home.

427
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,798
What's that?

428
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:58,320
No, I don't know what you get when
you cross a Norwegian and a Swede.

429
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:00,478
Very good, sir. Very good.

430
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:03,519
I can't tell you how ex cited we are

431
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:07,885
about bringing Icelandic investment
to the great Northwest.

432
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,402
Would you put
my brother back on, please?

433
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:13,286
Jerry, who the hell is that joker?

434
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:16,007
You're sure that he's the boss?

435
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:19,716
Make sure they don't start taking
eggnog in to the pilot.

436
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:24,756
Jer, I've got the jet gassed up
and on the runway in Seattle.

437
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:27,316
Usher them through customs,
make your connection,

438
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:32,356
and save me some
of whatever it is that they're having.

439
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:35,085
Yeah!

440
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,806
Audrey! I didn't hear you come in.

441
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,925
What is it this time?

442
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:45,277
Dad, are you ashamed of me?

443
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:50,043
Audrey, you're my daughter.

444
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:54,246
I was thinking about what we
talked about when you were so mad.

445
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,001
It isn't that I'm ashamed
of you, Audrey.

446
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:59,925
It's just that I wish
I could depend on you more.

447
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:02,885
Especially during
a trying time like this.

448
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:06,164
That's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

449
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,926
Dad, I wanna change my life.

450
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:12,477
I've decided I wanna help you
with the family business.

451
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:15,400
One of these days
you'll need someone to take over.

452
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:17,836
Obviously, it's not gonna be Johnny.

453
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:21,039
Oh, Audrey! I wish
that I could believe you.

454
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,437
Daddy, please!

455
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:27,196
I saw a friend of mine...

456
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:32,319
cut down like a flower
that had just begun to bloom.

457
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:37,200
Life can be so short.

458
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,999
There isn't all the time in the world.
I see that now.

459
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,561
And I wanna change my life.

460
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:47,241
How, exactly?

461
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:52,276
I don't need college. You can teach me.
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

462
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:55,484
All right.
We've got some guests arriving.

463
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:58,445
You go upstairs
and start making some beds.

464
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:00,996
You still don't believe me?

465
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,796
All right. OK. OK.

466
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,527
All right. All right.

467
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,718
Where would you start?

468
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,799
I think I should start
at the department store.

469
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:16,999
Cosmetics, or something.
Part time, at first, till I graduate.

470
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,397
You're really serious, aren't you?

471
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:24,805
You have to start to think about
the future, Daddy. Just like I am.

472
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:28,602
- The future?
- Our family's future.

473
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:32,402
Please let me be your daughter again.

474
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,718
Audrey.

475
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,242
Hello, this is Benjamin Horne.

476
00:36:05,327 --> 00:36:08,046
I have to take this, sweetheart.

477
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,317
Oh, OK.

478
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,558
Thanks, Daddy.

479
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:25,324
Thank you, Audrey.

480
00:36:32,447 --> 00:36:34,881
Where have you been?

481
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:38,642
Meet me down by the river
in a half hour.

482
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,798
And be discreet.

483
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:49,366
Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong.
He's a parakeet.

484
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:53,844
- Put it with the others.
- Cooper, Gordon Cole on the phone.

485
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,795
Coop, Albert is faxing you his
reconstruction of the plastic object

486
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,844
found in Laura Palmer's stomach.

487
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:05,127
He says the marks on her shoulders
are made by a parrot or a mynah bird.

488
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:07,960
That's it. You're up to date.

489
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,645
- Take a look at this.
- Something with the letter J.

490
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,883
A poker chip. One-Eyed Jacks.

491
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:18,319
Waldo!

492
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,803
Harry, Agent Cooper.
It's a mynah bird named Waldo.

493
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:26,762
- Owned by Jacques Renault.
- I'll get his home address.

494
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:29,600
When two separate events
occur simultaneously

495
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,366
pertaining to
the same object of inquiry,

496
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:35,524
we must always pay strict attention.

497
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:37,558
Fellas, let's make a house call.

498
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:09,037
Jacques, it's Harry Truman.
Open the door.

499
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:21,845
- He's heading around the side.
- Go get him.

500
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,204
- Let's get forensics and seal this room.
- Harry?

501
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:37,002
- Yeah, Hawk.
- He got away. I lost him in the woods.

502
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,123
Harry.

503
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,001
"L. J." Leo Johnson.

504
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:48,358
- Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.
- That's our connection.

505
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:15,396
Nice touch, Leo. Bright red sports car
for a secret meeting. Nice.

506
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:17,683
If you don't like it, get somebody else.

507
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:19,997
Hank said you were gifted,
I believed him.

508
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,403
But, Leo, your whole approach,
it's misguided.

509
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:26,525
Major career opportunity
staring you in the face,

510
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:31,397
and all you can think about is car wax
and chicken-feed drug transactions.

511
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,525
I'm out $10,000. Maybe that's
peanuts to you, not to me.

512
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,885
You were in business with a couple
of glue-sniffing squish-heads, Leo.

513
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:42,283
The Renault brothers?
I broke up their act.

514
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,007
This is Bernie.

515
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:49,638
Jacques's back in Canada.
We had a long talk. He's staying there.

516
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,923
Jacques was the brains in the outfit.

517
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,925
Bernie made bail this morning
on possession.

518
00:39:56,087 --> 00:40:00,797
Do we know if the late Bernard
gave you up?

519
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:03,805
I told him if he ever did, I'd kill him.

520
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:05,406
Did he?

521
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:09,805
No. He shouldn't have trusted me,
but like I said, Bernie wasn't too bright.

522
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,885
OK. One last chance, Leo.

523
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:14,958
Don't disappoint me.

524
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,640
The mill?

525
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:21,039
Keep it simple. Insurance investigator
should read "arson",

526
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,761
block letters, about six feet high.

527
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:27,636
- The deal as we discussed?
- The rest on delivery.

528
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,761
Three nights, Leo. Green light.

529
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,077
It's that clear enough?

530
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:37,163
But if Mrs Palmer
knows about the necklace...

531
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:40,285
- How could she know?
- She said she had a vision.

532
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:43,086
She saw someone take it.

533
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:44,885
Donna.

534
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,841
Donna, it's not here.

535
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,238
Somebody must have seen us
and followed us here.

536
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,598
How? How could Mrs Palmer know?

537
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:59,199
Laura used to say
her mother was kind of spooky.

538
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:02,717
She used to see things and have
these dreams. Laura did, too.

539
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:14,919
- Maybe we should tell somebody.
- You mean the police?

540
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:18,397
- If it was the killer, then he knows...
- The police didn't love Laura!

541
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:20,597
Nobody loved her but us.

542
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:25,606
I keep thinking I'm gonna see her.

543
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:29,760
I think I'm gonna catch a glimpse
of her out of the corner of my eye.

544
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,402
- Sometimes it's like I really do see her.
- James, listen.

545
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,564
We're gonna find out who killed her.

546
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,002
This is about us.

547
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:43,996
We have to do this for us,
not just for her.

548
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:59,881
James, I wanna be with you.

549
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:21,722
- Hello?
- Josie, it's me.

550
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:26,165
We just got a break
on the Palmer case. I can't get away.

551
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,763
- I miss you. I need to talk to you.
- I wanna talk to you, too.

552
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:33,681
Josie, were you at the Timber
Falls Motel this afternoon?

553
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,042
I have to go.
Call me tomorrow?

554
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,799
Goodbye.

555
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:48,244
Blow the whistle, Josie.
It's quitting time.

556
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,518
How did the shift go, Pete?

557
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:55,600
Cut some wood, made some lumber.

558
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:58,918
- I'm so tired I...
- ...could eat a horse?

559
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:03,160
- I make you a turkey sandwich.
- That's fantastic, Josie.

560
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,603
- Is Catherine asleep?
- Yeah.

561
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:10,396
Good, then give me
some mayo with that.

562
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:15,882
Josie, how do you feel about fish?

563
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:18,641
- To eat?
- No, to catch.

564
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:21,958
See, the Fishing Association,

565
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:26,325
their annual do is coming up.
I'm defending champion.

566
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:31,083
And this year they're adding
a mixed doubles division.

567
00:43:31,247 --> 00:43:35,798
I thought, well, if you were interested...

568
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:41,397
What the heck!
Would you like to partner up with me?

569
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:44,917
Well, Pete, I don't know
the first step about fishing.

570
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:49,563
Josie, there's enough fishing in me
for the both of us.

571
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,605
- Well, what do you think?
- Sure, Pete.

572
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:55,161
Let's give it the run at the money.

573
00:43:56,127 --> 00:43:59,642
Josie, you're my kind of girl. Here.

574
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,002
I'm gonna hit the hay.

575
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:05,881
- Sweet dreams, Pete.
- Sweet dreams, Josie.

576
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:44,961
Hello?

577
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:48,324
- Did you get my message?
- Yes.

578
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:54,482
Catch you later.
