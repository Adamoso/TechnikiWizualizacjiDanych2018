1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,005
Previously on "Twin Peaks"...

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:05,635
I shot him, Bobby.

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:07,240
I know I did.

4
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:11,240
- What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

5
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:19,318
Leo, no!

6
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:20,806
Leo, no!

7
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,606
This was hidden in the desk.

8
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:28,118
- Then we can proceed.
- Is it set for tonight?

9
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:29,515
Yes...

10
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:32,485
- What policy is this?
- Your new life insurance.

11
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:36,959
Are you suggesting that there's
something...irregular at work here?

12
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:40,557
- Rejected, that's what he said.
- Nadine, don't you give up.

13
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:46,437
Sign here.
Welcome to One-Eyed Jacks, Hester.

14
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:49,596
Place your bets.

15
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:52,687
- Jacques, is it?
- That's me.

16
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,918
Say goodbye, James.

17
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,517
What's up, Doc?

18
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:01,518
I want to see you.

19
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:32,486
- Where do we look?
- I don't know. Everywhere.

20
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,677
Where shall we start?

21
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,242
Maybe this is something.

22
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:50,044
Umbrellas?

23
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:56,999
"The Kahala Hilton, July 1969,
men on the moon..."

24
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:01,364
"August 9th, 197 4,"

25
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:04,121
"I first lay eyes on Mimsy."

26
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,676
- Weird!
- Yeah.

27
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,567
- James!
- What d'you do?

28
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,242
- I just hit a button.
- Hit it again.

29
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,439
There's gotta be
a way to turn it off.

30
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,087
My little coconut.

31
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,436
James!

32
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:55,806
Laura said something
on her tape about a coconut.

33
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,316
Oh, my God, the necklace!

34
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,957
OK, Laura...

35
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,687
this is where you shot that video.

36
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,245
Now just tell me...

37
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:30,677
Tell me why you sent me
to Sparkwood and 21?

38
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,205
Oh, my God!

39
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,644
No!

40
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:46,997
- Red, 36.
- Sorry, I guess our date's off.

41
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:50,039
- 77.
- Pay red.

42
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,038
No, let it ride.

43
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:54,004
Excuse me, can I get...?

44
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,564
Sir, are you absolutely sure
you want another card?

45
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,439
Yes, please.

46
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,561
Twenty-one! Can you beat that?

47
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,963
Mother always said I was born lucky.

48
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,405
Maybe later.

49
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,164
Thanks for asking.

50
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,046
This is for you.

51
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,279
I'm a friend of Leo's.

52
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,998
Who's Leo?

53
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,159
Buy you a cocktail, Jacques?

54
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,398
Come in.

55
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,915
T urn around.

56
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:25,401
Yes...

57
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:28,764
Very nice.
Come over here.

58
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:41,720
- Something wrong?
- Uh-uh.

59
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,964
This is a good night
for you to break in.

60
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,756
The owner's coming by, he likes
to spend time with the new girls.

61
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:53,205
- Who's that?
- No names, child.

62
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:56,205
You don't offer, and you don't ask.

63
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,680
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,282
Pick a card.

65
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:24,157
- How long you been dealing Blackjack?
- Long enough to spot a card counter.

66
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,198
You let card counters
buy you a drink?

67
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,756
I don't see tips like that everyday.

68
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:33,796
- Leo ever mention me to you?
- I don't know, Mr. Who are you?

69
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,845
I can't believe
Leo never told you about me.

70
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:42,325
- Maybe he did, I don't know.
- Leo played you like a violin.

71
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:47,083
He had you taking all the risk and
never cut you a piece of the action.

72
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,636
I don't know
what you're talking about.

73
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:53,766
Take that chip out of your pocket
and take a look. Go ahead.

74
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,196
That chip has a special significance.

75
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,359
A very special night
you spent up at your cabin.

76
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,364
Here's a clue.

77
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,961
"Laura! Laura!"

78
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,204
Come on, take it easy.
Take it easy!

79
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:11,002
How do you think a low-rent hump
like Leo has been financing this?

80
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,045
You...

81
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,317
I'm the bank.

82
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,598
- He never mentioned your name.
- Course not.

83
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,918
Leo buys with my cash,
and you mule it across the border.

84
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,481
- He tell you who's distributing Stateside?
- No.

85
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,121
- Some high school kid...
- That's right.

86
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:32,399
We're in sync now, Jacques,
can you feel it? Can you?

87
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,639
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Good.

88
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,640
'Cause I've got a job for you tonight.

89
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,844
No Leo. No middleman.

90
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:47,316
It's ten grand.
Half now, half on completion.

91
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,081
How's that sound?

92
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,797
Sounds good.

93
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,160
What are we doing?

94
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:58,599
Meet me at the plant
on Black Lake in two hours.

95
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,958
- Is that going to be a problem?
- No. No problem.

96
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,004
Good.

97
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,845
One more question, Jacques.

98
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:15,762
Leo told me all about that night
at the cabin with the girls.

99
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,959
I'm curious about the chip.
How'd that happen?

100
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:24,561
- It was that crazy bird.
- Bird?

101
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:28,037
It had a thing for Laura,
saying her name all the time,

102
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,562
like he's in love or something.

103
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,564
So we're all partying.

104
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,195
The girls are getting high,
everybody's crazy...

105
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,002
- You, Laura and Ronnette.
- Leo lets Waldo out of the cage...

106
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:42,437
The birdie lands on her shoulder.

107
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:46,236
Laura's all tied up.
Oh, she liked that.

108
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:50,155
The birdy starts pecking
on her shoulder, like love pecks.

109
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,721
Know what I mean? So Leo...

110
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:58,120
he's doing a number on her, and
she's screaming about that damn bird.

111
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:01,359
So Leo takes out a chip,

112
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,797
puts it in her mouth and says,

113
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,600
"Bite the bullet, baby."

114
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,957
"Bite the bullet."

115
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:18,084
Thanks for clearing that up.

116
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah, no problem.

117
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:24,559
- See you on the other side.
- Can do, Cappy.

118
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,680
Got a trout on the line, Hawk.

119
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,717
This one's a keeper.

120
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:43,200
- I'm just gonna sit here, OK?
- Come here, sweetie.

121
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,636
Look, we got all night, baby!

122
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,041
Aren't you...?

123
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,801
Yeah. I'm just gonna put this...

124
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,201
Yes...

125
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,762
You made me do this, Shelly.

126
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,280
You made me!

127
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,682
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

128
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:58,523
As we say in the law enforcement
game, "It's a cold trail."

129
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,397
Ah, women!

130
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:09,285
Harry? Hawk here. The trout's
heading upstream towards the net.

131
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,883
Hawk, hold the line.
We'll set the hook.

132
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:16,403
- You got a 20 on Agent Cooper?
- He's downstream ten minutes.

133
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,440
He'll probably miss the catch,
but he'll be there when we grill him.

134
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:25,397
Copy that. We'll make our move as
soon as the big fish shows his fins.

135
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:27,841
Ready, Andy?

136
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,804
Ready, Harry.

137
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,596
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

138
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,918
- Put them on the roof of the car!
- You heard him!

139
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,883
Get in there and cuff him.

140
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,241
Don't move!

141
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:56,246
You're under arrest for the attempted
murder of Ronnette Pulaski

142
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:59,162
and the murder of Laura Palmer.

143
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,636
Give me your other hand.

144
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:07,243
- He's got my gun!
- Harry, look out!

145
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,560
Andy...?

146
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,605
- Are you OK, Harry?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:19,605
- Better call that ambulance.
- Yeah.

148
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:23,242
...held against you in a court of law,
you have a right to an attorney...

149
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:28,481
Hello?

150
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,799
All clear.

151
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,481
I'll be there as soon as I can.

152
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,922
Hey, what's up, Doc?

153
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:44,555
It's Laura,
in case you haven't guessed.

154
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:49,243
It's Thursday 23rd, and I'm so bored.

155
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:53,804
Actually, I'm in kind of a weird mood.

156
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,044
God, James is sweet,
but he's so dumb.

157
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,519
And right now I can only take
so much of sweet!

158
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:08,680
Hey, remember that
mystery man I told you about?

159
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:14,717
Well, if I tell you his name,
then you're going to be in trouble.

160
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:20,519
He wouldn't be a mystery man anymore,
but you might be history, man!

161
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,799
I think a couple of times
he's tried to kill me.

162
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,963
But guess what?

163
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:30,915
As you know, I sure got off on it.

164
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,357
Isn't sex weird?

165
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:41,717
This guy can really light
my F-l-R-E.

166
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,286
As in red Corvette.

167
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,605
Uh-oh!

168
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:51,764
Here comes Mom
with milk and cookies.

169
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,918
- Donna?
- Dad!

170
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,600
Bye-bye.

171
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,166
I've got an emergency
at the hospital.

172
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:03,797
See if your mother needs anything.
I'll call later.

173
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,279
James...

174
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:11,803
It's OK, I'm glad I heard her say it.
I'm glad.

175
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,435
I might have gone my whole life...

176
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:18,679
- I'm sorry you had to hear that.
- I'm OK.

177
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,476
Jacoby didn't kill her.
He was trying to help her.

178
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:24,763
Then how did he get the necklace?

179
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,404
Do you hear that?

180
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:23,566
You've got one hour to think
about what you've done to me.

181
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,400
And think about it!

182
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,401
'Cause by then
Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead!

183
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,235
You broke my heart!

184
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,722
Goodbye.

185
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:46,477
It's all here.

186
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,524
Very generous, Josie.

187
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,401
Sitting in that concrete box
all that time,

188
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:56,520
90 grand seemed like
all the money in creation.

189
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,564
It kept me going.

190
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,806
It's a funny thing.

191
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,800
Back in the world...I don't know...

192
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,761
...it seems kind of light.

193
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,240
We had an agreement.

194
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:20,716
I've been going over this
in my mind and...

195
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,481
If you could follow my thinking...

196
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:25,603
We're all born into life,

197
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:30,921
we have a certain number of years
to breathe and have our being.

198
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:36,086
That's from a book on Oriental
philosophy I read in the joint.

199
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:40,877
Maybe somebody, somewhere,
knows how much time we have.

200
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,481
I don't. Do you?

201
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:50,081
So, when a man gives up a portion
of his life, 18 months for instance,

202
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,438
how does he place a value on that time?

203
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,997
18 months...90,000...

204
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,164
What's that? 5,000 a month?

205
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:04,878
Not bad if you live another 50 years,
but what if you've only another 20?

206
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,924
Or ten?

207
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:10,602
Or some unforeseen event
kills you tomorrow?

208
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:15,795
Like the boating accident
that killed your late husband, Andrew.

209
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:22,799
Or say you just got out of prison,

210
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:27,762
where you went in
for vehicular manslaughter,

211
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:33,480
as part of an agreement to avoid
being implicated in a greater crime,

212
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,319
murder,

213
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,439
for which, in fact,
you were responsible.

214
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,684
But nowthere's this threat,
this possible threat,

215
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:45,203
that this fact could be discovered.

216
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,399
And in one stroke,
10, 15 or 20 more years of your life

217
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,956
could be cut right out
from underneath you.

218
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,925
So I've been asking myself,

219
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:58,956
what does that do to the market
value of 18 months?

220
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:03,957
We had an agreement.

221
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:08,121
And we still do, sweetheart.

222
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:10,602
Signed, sealed, delivered.

223
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:14,717
And I want to take care
of everything we agreed to.

224
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:19,802
You want a lot for your money,
and I want a lot for my time.

225
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:24,043
There's a saying in the joint.

226
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,802
It's not Oriental philosophy,

227
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:32,638
but it has a similar logic that
appeals to my...spiritual nature.

228
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,646
"Once you're in business with
somebody, you're in business for life."

229
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,962
Like a marriage.

230
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:58,126
Partner.

231
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,436
Damn!

232
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:25,559
Where is it?

233
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,843
Where is it?

234
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,242
Catherine...?

235
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,642
The account ledger, have you seen it?

236
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:35,765
Don't you keep it
in that little safe at home?

237
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:38,606
It's not in the safe at home,
it's not anywhere!

238
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:42,037
- Tell me you didn't take it.
- I didn't take it.

239
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,801
Pete, tell me the truth.

240
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,600
You're not helping her
to pull something here.

241
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,479
- Who?
- Josie.

242
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,880
No!

243
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,320
- Pull what here?
- Oh, Peter.

244
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,524
Forget everything we've ever done
to hurt each other.

245
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,597
- Just like that!
- Temporarily.

246
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:08,525
Our marriage is
a living train wreck, but...

247
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:12,236
there used to be something
caring between us.

248
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,238
The fella who caught my eye.

249
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:19,000
The lumberjack who could
scamper up a tree like a cat.

250
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:23,806
The boss's sister
from that big house on the hill.

251
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:28,355
A summer's indiscretion
and here we are.

252
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,404
Catherine!

253
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,724
Oh, Pete!

254
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:38,236
I never should have taken you
to that house on the hill.

255
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:42,366
Well, I have no complaints
about the house.

256
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,006
As for me,

257
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:48,483
taking my pleasure
in lashing out at the one person

258
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:52,037
who was decent enough to stand
by me through all my foolishness.

259
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,244
I knowthings haven't been
easy for you.

260
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,885
Peter...

261
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:04,360
Somewhere under all that scar tissue,

262
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,206
there's the faintest flicker
of what we once felt.

263
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:10,478
I'm asking you to feel that now.

264
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,276
Why...exactly?

265
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,676
Because I'm in trouble.

266
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,919
Given what I've become
and how I've treated people,

267
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:25,160
there's no one else I can turn to.
I need your help.

268
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:30,966
Catherine!

269
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,884
Catherine!

270
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,555
So Fred starts to cuff him,

271
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:46,598
and Harry turns to go.

272
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,918
Suddenly, Jacques throws
an elbow at Fred...WHAM!

273
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:54,598
In one move, he takes Fred's gun...
and he's got the drop on Harry.

274
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,719
Harry is deader
than a pound of roadside stew!

275
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:02,125
Then, all of a sudden,
a single shot rings out.

276
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,206
- Andy, my man!
- All right, Andy!

277
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:16,923
Go ahead, Andy,
give it your best shot! Go on!

278
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,405
Oh, Andy!

279
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,483
Oh, Punky...

280
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,364
I'm pregnant.

281
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,559
Uh-oh!

282
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,962
Fresh coffee.

283
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,523
- What?
- Let me talk to the sheriff.

284
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:46,283
The sheriff isn't in at the moment.
Would you care to leave a message?

285
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:51,399
You tell him Leo Johnson said
to check out James Hurley.

286
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:55,003
- He's an easy rider.
- An easy rider?

287
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:00,036
- You got that?
- Yes, but Leo, wait! Leo!

288
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:11,283
Did you take Laura and Ronnette
up to your cabin that night?

289
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:15,201
They'd both been up there before.
They was no nuns!

290
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,046
That's where you took the pictures
for "Flesh World"?

291
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,998
That was Laura's idea.

292
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:22,880
She talked Ronnette
into making them ads.

293
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:26,602
What did you and Leo
fight about that night?

294
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,042
Bastard hit me with a whiskey bottle!

295
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,643
- Why?
- I don't know, that's why we fought!

296
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:36,117
I'm bleeding like a stuck pig,
and he's laughing.

297
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,523
So you used Leo's shirt to stop
the bleeding. What then?

298
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,399
I got sick.

299
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:47,164
I go outside, pass out.
I wake up, I'm laying on the ground.

300
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:52,477
- Where was Leo?
- Leo and the girls, they're gone.

301
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:56,486
- What about the train car?
- I don't know nothing about that.

302
00:28:56,647 --> 00:29:00,435
I come down the hill,
Leo's car is gone.

303
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:05,485
Had to walk 15 miles
back to my own house.

304
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,919
When they brought him in,
he was rambling incoherently.

305
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:16,005
These things he said to you,
they're pretty incredible.

306
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,000
I know. Let's hope he pulls through.

307
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,397
Well, he's stabilised anyway.

308
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:25,845
So Leo had to take the girls
to the train car by himself?

309
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:29,522
- You believe him?
- He's too stupid to lie.

310
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:31,603
He'll testify against Leo,
we got him.

311
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,803
We got to find Leo first.

312
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:37,198
- Doc, how's Jacoby?
- He's out of the woods.

313
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:41,918
Listen...he says he got a phone call
from Laura Palmer.

314
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,164
He was on his way to see her
when he was jumped.

315
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,324
- Any description of the assailant?
- He didn't see him.

316
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:53,277
But he says he saw Laura Palmer
by the gazebo in Easter Park.

317
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,600
It's not here!

318
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,200
It's not here!

319
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:03,837
It's not here, either. Damn!

320
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,919
Oh...

321
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,595
...Midge!

322
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,523
Midge Jones.

323
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,956
What are you doing?

324
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:19,403
It's...my old high school yearbook.

325
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:22,721
I thought it was gone forever.

326
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh, Pete.

327
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,720
Sorry.

328
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

329
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,243
It's at the mill.

330
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:40,524
- What is?
- What you're looking for.

331
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:43,963
Drying shed three,
near the north gate.

332
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,924
Pete...

333
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,519
Yes, I'll look in the other room.

334
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:58,359
What do you want? Talk terms.

335
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,084
We'll let you know.

336
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,877
Norma, you still have that
down comforter on your bed?

337
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,685
Yes, Hank.

338
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:27,765
The mattresses
they give you on your bunk,

339
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,681
they're probably...
this thick, you know.

340
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:35,917
And you lie there at night...thinking,

341
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:40,916
"If this mattress is so skinny, how
did they get all those rocks inside?"

342
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:46,525
So...you'll forgive me
if I tell you that night after night,

343
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:51,163
I dreamed of you
lying on that big feather bed.

344
00:31:56,007 --> 00:32:02,276
I guess the hired help shouldn't be so
familiar with the boss lady, eh?

345
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,041
I can't blame you for dreaming.

346
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,517
I wasn't just dreaming
about being with you, Norma.

347
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:10,917
What I was trying to...

348
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:16,165
- I shouldn't be saying this much.
- I think you should.

349
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,046
No...I haven't earned the right,
Norma.

350
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,123
I've been back what? Two days.

351
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:24,159
Say what you want to say.

352
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:31,715
I've been trying to picture a whole
life with you...with the diner.

353
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:35,044
Making it soar. Making it blue sky.

354
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,358
I always talk too big,
that's my biggest fault.

355
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,280
I learned that talking
to my counsellor inside.

356
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:47,205
This is new territory for me.

357
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,044
But I'm gonna try.

358
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:54,443
You know...it's 20 years
we've been together next month.

359
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:56,279
Can you believe it?

360
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,358
Maybe we're doing this all backwards.

361
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:02,076
Maybe it's the next 20 that counts.

362
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,559
Give me time, Norma.
I'll make you proud of me yet.

363
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,878
Nadine?

364
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,360
Nadine?

365
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,478
Honey?

366
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:45,724
Oh, God! Nadine, don't you do this.

367
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:47,041
Nadine!

368
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:55,915
I need an ambulance.
My wife has just taken some pills.

369
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,878
422, Riverside.

370
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,277
For the love of God, hurry!

371
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,716
Stay with me, Nadine.

372
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,158
Please, don't go.

373
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,678
Stay with me.

374
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:22,163
Leo Johnson's gone to ground.
I bet he's holed up near his home.

375
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:25,723
- Sheriff, Leo Johnson called.
- When?

376
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:28,355
Ten minutes ago.
He left this message.

377
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:33,840
And Sheriff, in the background
I could hear a clock striking.

378
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:37,966
- What kind of clock, Lucy?
- Like the clock at Easter Park.

379
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:41,318
- Harry!
- Hawk. Good work, Lucy.

380
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,278
Pull surveillance off Leo's house.

381
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,363
Set up a perimeter
around Easter Park.

382
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:48,479
- Got it.
- You get some cars over there.

383
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,842
Harry, I gotta talk to you...

384
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,717
Harry, let me talk to James.
You want to investigate this?

385
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:57,724
Come on, James.

386
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,281
Harry...

387
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:04,521
Harry, is it true?

388
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:08,521
- You've found the killer?
- We've arrested a suspect.

389
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:12,640
- But is it him, Harry?
- I can't release any details now.

390
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:14,718
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

391
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:19,921
Leland, there's nothing you can do here.
You should be home with Sarah now.

392
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,641
Yes, you're right.
Of course, you're right.

393
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,476
- You're going back to the hospital?
- No, I'm heading home.

394
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:30,600
- Thank you, Will.
- Don't give it a thought.

395
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,884
Hospital...

396
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:44,282
I think you ought to listen
to this tape.

397
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:45,800
Why's that?

398
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,356
It was Laura's. We found it.

399
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:52,082
I think it'll help you find
who you're looking for.

400
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:56,081
- Who might that be?
- Somebody with a red Corvette.

401
00:35:57,847 --> 00:36:00,566
Doctor Jacoby's in hospital
with a heart attack.

402
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,799
- Heart attack?
- He said he saw Laura tonight.

403
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:08,520
What kind of dangerous game
have you been playing?

404
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,963
Is Jacoby gonna be all right?

405
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:20,560
I've been very patient
with you, James.

406
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:26,083
From here on out, I'm gonna need
a better set of answers.

407
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:35,203
Let's start with why this was
in the gas tank of your bike?

408
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,564
Fine, fine, fine. OK.

409
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:49,566
OK. Ghostwood, fantastic!

410
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,638
I love it!

411
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:54,156
All your revisions are included.

412
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:58,878
Ben, I am so happy,
I can't even say how much.

413
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:03,762
- After you.
- No, no, no!

414
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:05,679
After you.

415
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:07,803
After me!

416
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,326
Excuse me.

417
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,320
Benjamin Horne here.

418
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,077
Time to black flag that little firebug.

419
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:20,920
Leo Johnson's gonna get
a house call.

420
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,839
Proceed.

421
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,196
Shelly?

422
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,998
Shelly, are you here?

423
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,520
- Shelly's not here, Bobby.
- Leo!

424
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:50,645
- Am I glad to see you...
- Something I can help you with?

425
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:54,163
It's you I was looking for.
The cops are after you.

426
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:55,885
Liar!

427
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,406
Shelly's dead! You killed her!

428
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:07,038
Leo!

429
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:25,164
Later, Leo.

430
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:07,481
I can't understand a word,
you have a thing in your mouth.

431
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:21,603
- Who are you?
- Shelly Johnson.

432
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,439
- You know who called me here?
- No. Please help me.

433
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:29,326
Be quiet...l'm thinking.

434
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,361
Oh, God.

435
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,523
Oh, God!

436
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:18,116
- Any of the boys still inside?
- Not sure.

437
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,478
Shift was over, but we're
still trying to get a count.

438
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,638
- Seen Catherine?
- No, Pete.

439
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:25,365
That's her car.

440
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,085
Jesus God!

441
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:29,602
You think she's still inside?

442
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,600
I guess I'm gonna have to find out.

443
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:37,599
Pete, that ain't such a good idea.

444
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:43,487
She's still my wife.

445
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:56,164
Catherine!

446
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:00,043
And that is that!

447
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,517
Ben, is this a great moment?

448
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,605
- Ghostwood!
- Incredible!

449
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,883
Ghostwood, eh?

450
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:16,326
Einar, tonight
you play on the house.

451
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:20,526
This is...marvellous.

452
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:23,798
Enjoy, my friend, enjoy!

453
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,601
To Ghostwood.

454
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:30,521
To Ghostwood Estates
and Country Club!

455
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:37,687
Congratulations, Boss.

456
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:43,316
Blackie, old pal...

457
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:46,356
this calls for a celebration.

458
00:42:46,527 --> 00:42:50,042
Let's have a look...at the new girl.

459
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,083
Good luck, honey.

460
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:06,640
Close your eyes.

461
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:11,685
This is such stuff
as dreams are made of.

462
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:23,042
Diane, 4:37 am.

463
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,637
After a long investigative night,
returning to the Great Northern.

464
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:31,323
One suspect in custody. Leo Johnson,
who I believe killed Laura Palmer,

465
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:35,326
won't be able to escape
the dragnet much longer.

466
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:41,317
As you can hear
from the ambient sound around me,

467
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:45,520
and I notice, with some relief,
the Icelandic group on my floor

468
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:48,525
have either checked or passed out,

469
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:54,122
I may not need the earplugs
which I received today, Diane,

470
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:58,718
although I may put them to use
as a precautionary measure.

471
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,724
I ordered hot milk from room service.

472
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:05,722
Here's hoping that does the job, and
I can catch some quality sack time.

473
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:11,316
24-hour room service, the premier
achievement of modern civilisation.

474
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,478
"My Special Agent".

475
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,725
