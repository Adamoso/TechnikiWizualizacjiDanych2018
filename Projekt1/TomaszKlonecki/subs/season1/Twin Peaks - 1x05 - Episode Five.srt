1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,165
Previously on "Twin Peaks"...

2
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:05,676
Where's the book
that spells bankruptcy?

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,162
I have more than one hiding place.

4
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,003
- Hi.
- Who are you?

5
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:16,325
My name's Madeleine Ferguson.
Laura was my cousin.

6
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,045
Laura had...

7
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,121
...secrets.

8
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:25,763
He'll see I'm the woman of his dreams.
I'll help him find who killed Laura.

9
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,923
My log saw something that night.

10
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,997
This was in Leo's truck
after Laura was murdered.

11
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:36,516
Leo won't be a problem any more.

12
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:43,361
Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault.

13
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,404
Are you OK?

14
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,195
Hank got his parole.

15
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,795
He's coming home.

16
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,567
- Did you get my message?
- Yes.

17
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,445
Catch you later.

18
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:53,441
Diane, it is 4:28 am.

19
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:59,040
I've just been woken up by a God-awful
racket which you can probably hear.

20
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,245
Can you hear that?

21
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:07,840
Up until now, I've had only pleasant,
courteous service at this hotel.

22
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,766
It proves that once a traveller
leaves home,

23
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:13,561
he loses almost 100°/of his ability

24
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:15,564
to control his environment.

25
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,718
Send two pairs of those silicon earplugs

26
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,878
I used on my trip to New York.

27
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:25,642
I didn't bring them because
I felt it was unnecessary.

28
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,360
However...

29
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:45,120
- Coffee?
- Please.

30
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,558
- What's with the choir practice?
- Business junket. From Iceland.

31
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,679
Got in about 3:00 this morning.

32
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,596
- They're on my floor.
- Lucky you.

33
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:00,043
It'll take them a day to reset
their biological clocks.

34
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,636
Hope the herring holds out.

35
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,440
How are you?

36
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:13,638
Audrey, to be perfectly honest,
I'm tired and a little on edge.

37
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,806
- I got a job.
- Good for you.

38
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,761
Now I can help you with your case.
Guess where I'm gonna...

39
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:28,846
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm late, I only have time for coffee.

40
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,918
Maybe I could go with you.

41
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:35,120
Wednesdays were usually a school day
when I was your age.

42
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,521
I can't believe
you were ever my age.

43
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:42,485
I've got the pictures to prove it.

44
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,605
- How old are you?
- 18.

45
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,558
We'll see you later, Audrey.

46
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,604
See you later.

47
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,400
Bye.

48
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,364
See you later, sons of Odin.
How do you say that?

49
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,327
My brother'll love you guys.

50
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:20,400
Brother Ben, I bring you greetings
from the treeless tundra of Iceland.

51
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:24,839
We have had complaints
from nearly every guest in the hotel.

52
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,520
What are they on?

53
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,844
They are insane
for the Ghostwood Estates project.

54
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,756
I have had serious fun
with these Nordic animals.

55
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,686
And, Ben, I'm in love.
Her name is Heba.

56
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:41,483
She's a giant snow queen with a smile
like a sunrise on an ice floe.

57
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,041
You'd go blind looking at this girl.
Look!

58
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,157
See what she gave me?
A leg of lamb.

59
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,403
- Is that beautiful?
- Jerry!

60
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,923
Some garlic, some fresh mint.
That's rotisserie heaven.

61
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:57,404
- You gotta meet her.
- Just grab some downtime, will you?

62
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:02,522
We've laid in a gala reception
for your fair-haired boys tonight.

63
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:06,879
- Twin Peaks' best and brightest.
- Holding it in a phone booth?

64
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:11,205
And if we still need a kicker to nail
the sale, I'm thinking maybe...

65
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:15,605
they might enjoy
a little road trip up to...

66
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:17,565
you know where.

67
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:21,965
Jacks! I am honoured to know you.

68
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,486
Ben?

69
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,005
Leland, why are you here?

70
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:33,160
I know there's a new investment group
arriving today.

71
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,164
If there's anything I can do?

72
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:38,444
Leland, the best thing
that you can do...

73
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,400
is follow the doctor's orders.
You need rest.

74
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,081
I just feel...

75
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:48,482
I just feel I need something
to occupy my mind.

76
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,080
Take some time off,
for God's sake.

77
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,437
Fly somewhere. Take Sarah.

78
00:06:56,687 --> 00:07:00,123
I'm afraid to, Ben. I'm afraid.

79
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,841
Hawk, we're at Jacques Renault's
apartment. Get here soon.

80
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,796
Morning.
What have you got, Harry?

81
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:17,006
Renault's a Canadian national.
He worked the lumber fields...

82
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:20,563
until he put on a little weight
a couple of seasons ago.

83
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,843
Now he tends bar at the Roadhouse.

84
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:26,477
- Are there any more doughnuts?
- Sure. Andy?

85
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:31,402
And a cup of Joe. I didn't get
too much sleep last night.

86
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,199
You do look a bit peaked.

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,717
There's a group of insane men
staying on my floor.

88
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:38,406
Jacques Renault turn up?

89
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,883
No one's seen him.
We checked the building and the bar.

90
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,922
I sent Hawk to roust his brother,
but it looks like Bernie's jumped bail.

91
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,766
- Morning, Agent Cooper.
- Morning, Doc.

92
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,237
The blood on the shirt you found here
is AB negative.

93
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,278
It's not Laura's blood.

94
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:58,797
So, it was Renault's blood
on Leo Johnson's shirt.

95
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:06,038
Thank you, Andy.

96
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:16,522
- What about Leo Johnson?
- The APB went out. Nothing yet.

97
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:19,400
Harry, could you give me
a leg up here?

98
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:23,242
- Sure.
- What's Renault's blood type?

99
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,956
- Renault's blood is AB negative.
- Thanks, Doc.

100
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,924
My pleasure.

101
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,719
- Holy smoke! "Flesh World" again.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,846
Harry, remember that ad
with Ronnette Pulaski?

103
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,239
We traced it. It came to the magazine
in a plain envelope. No name.

104
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,244
The magazine's a clearing-house.

105
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,116
Readers write letters in response
to the ads and mail them in.

106
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:58,879
The magazine forwards them
to the advertisers. No direct contact.

107
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,481
Ronnette got letters at this PO box.

108
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,926
A local zip code.

109
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:09,485
My guess is this box will be registered
under the name Jacques Renault.

110
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:13,845
Let's see who was writing
to Ronnette. Postmarked Georgia.

111
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,395
Goodnight.

112
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:23,236
I don't know, the beard ruins
the effect of the lingerie.

113
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,165
What do you think?

114
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:30,482
- The guy's no Georgia peach.
- Poor bastard.

115
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:34,720
Did you notice the picture
of Leo Johnson's truck on that page?

116
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:48,242
- I love it when you cook for me.
- Leo hates my cooking.

117
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:52,004
Leo missed the boat with you, baby.

118
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:57,241
The biggest mistake of your life was
dropping out of school to marry him.

119
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,279
What would you do
if he walked in right now?

120
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,398
Come here.

121
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,998
Come here.

122
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:18,397
Hey, Leo! How's it going, man?

123
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,205
What a surprise!

124
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:24,883
Now, Leo, Shelly tells me
that you don't like her cooking.

125
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:27,282
Tell you what, she and I...

126
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:32,197
we're going to sit here while you
cook breakfast for us, you hump.

127
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:38,004
If you so much as utter
one harsh syllable to this...

128
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,886
beautiful girl...

129
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm gonna shoot
your ugly face off, OK?

130
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,042
Sheriff's deputy.

131
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:53,240
Do exactly what we said,
and everything's gonna be fine.

132
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,641
Come here.

133
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,246
- Hi, Andy. Come on in.
- Hi, Shelly.

134
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,478
Do you know when Leo's back?

135
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:15,037
- Is he in trouble?
- We just want to talk to him.

136
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,802
- Is this about Laura?
- Why do you say that?

137
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,481
I heard him talking to Jacques
the night he left.

138
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,160
Jacques Renault?

139
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,837
Yeah. They were outside arguing.
I couldn't hear exactly, but...

140
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,601
they did seem
to be arguing about her.

141
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:35,439
- Call us if he gets in touch.
- OK, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

142
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:45,560
- How'd I do?
- You did great.

143
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,197
You drive me crazy.

144
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:00,926
Hello?

145
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:05,395
- Hi, Leo. Where you calling from?
- Has anybody come by?

146
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,485
What's that?
Is anybody looking for you?

147
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,878
- Why would anyone look for you?
- Are you sure?

148
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:15,557
You know how paranoid you get
after popping bennies.

149
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,327
- When are you coming home?
- Soon. You OK?

150
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, everything's fine, Leo.

151
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:26,801
- Come on home.
- I miss you, Shelly.

152
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,080
I miss you, too.

153
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:50,119
- Hey, good-looking.
- Hope you don't mind my coming.

154
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:51,919
Oh, no.

155
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,723
Nadine won't be back from that
patent attorney for a couple of hours.

156
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:01,079
- Silent drape runners?
- She's already spending the millions.

157
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:05,366
I have to put gas in my car
like everyone else, right?

158
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:11,561
I didn't want to tell you on the phone,
but Hank got his parole.

159
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,606
OK.

160
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,563
He'll be coming home.
I mean, back.

161
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:21,446
I only saw him
a minute before the hearing.

162
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:26,118
He seemed so hopeful,
I didn't want to say anything.

163
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:30,605
- You don't have to explain.
- Said anything to Nadine yet?

164
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:32,525
Haven't yet.

165
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,165
- Waiting for me to go first?
- No.

166
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:40,479
It's just that...Nadine's not well.

167
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,160
What are you saying?

168
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,884
I don't know.

169
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,283
I think I do.

170
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:55,805
- I don't ever want to hurt you.
- Maybe that's our trouble, Ed.

171
00:13:55,967 --> 00:14:00,483
We never want to hurt anyone.
We never just take what we want.

172
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:06,680
I think that this is how it is when
you get to the end of your life,

173
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,397
and you don't have anything
to show for it.

174
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:17,481
Don't call me.
I mean, not for a while, OK?

175
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:20,596
OK.

176
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:23,960
I love you, Ed.

177
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:44,237
- I remember when you were little.
- So did my father speak to you?

178
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,326
Yes, he did. And I can't tell you
how ex cited we are

179
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,878
to have you come on-board and
put in a hitch here at our flagship.

180
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:54,884
What did you have in mind?

181
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:59,637
Well, as per your father's suggestion,
starting low, aiming high,

182
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:04,005
we thought perhaps the wrapping
department. Gifts, etc.

183
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:07,995
- Part-time, after school.
- No, no, no.

184
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,559
Emory.

185
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,365
May I speak frankly?

186
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,801
Please do.

187
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:18,397
Let's talk...

188
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:20,799
...retail.

189
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,805
- Sales?
- Perfume.

190
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:29,317
One of our more sensitive areas.
Expensive items, customer relations.

191
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:33,964
- I've got my heart set on it, Emory.
- I'd have to talk to your father.

192
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,362
Emory, here's what we're gonna do.

193
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:40,685
You're gonna tell my father
I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes.

194
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,243
Then you'll put me to work
behind the perfume counter.

195
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:48,838
If you don't, I'll rip my dress,
scream at the top of my lungs

196
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,039
and tell my father
that you made a pass at me.

197
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,000
Does that help
clear things up for you?

198
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,759
Yes.

199
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,285
Yes, what?

200
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:04,606
Yes, Miss Horne.

201
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,123
Shall we start on the paperwork?

202
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:26,005
James, I got your note.

203
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:32,320
- Are you all right?
- There's some things I've gotta say.

204
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:37,242
I told you that my dad died
when I was 10? He didn't die.

205
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,721
He was a musician.
We lived out West.

206
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,363
- He ran off on me and my mom.
- I'm sorry.

207
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,963
My mom was a writer.
Poems and short stories.

208
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,677
She's an alcoholic.

209
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,802
If you have a problem with this...

210
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,521
I don't have a problem.
You tell me.

211
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,244
It's true she was out of town
this week, but...

212
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,921
she wasn't travelling.

213
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,839
What she does is
she goes to another town,

214
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:15,000
shacks up in some cheap hotel
with a couple of bottles...

215
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,806
picks up guys and....

216
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,045
It's all right.

217
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,565
I don't want to have
any secrets from you.

218
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,839
I don't want there to be any lies
between us.

219
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:40,319
Secrets kill people's happiness.
I don't want us to be like that.

220
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,485
We won't. We won't be.

221
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:50,442
We have to do what's right.

222
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,637
What you said yesterday was true.

223
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,640
If we don't find out
what happened to Laura,

224
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,798
it won't go away, our whole lives.

225
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,083
We will, James.

226
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:09,557
- She's out there, a restless spirit.
- I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

227
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:11,922
At least they're fresh. Here, Gary.

228
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,606
Oh, thanks.

229
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,961
- Here you go, Scott.
- Thank you.

230
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,000
There you are.

231
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,006
- What do you wanna mark this?
- "Duplicate".

232
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:28,643
- Do we have one like it?
- Yeah, the same stain as before.

233
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,639
Mark it "duplicate".

234
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,317
Red drapes.

235
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:39,076
That PO box was registered
to Jacques Renault.

236
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,558
Those are the letters responding
to Ronnette's ad.

237
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:46,197
Let's see if there's something
from someone we know.

238
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,046
- Hawk, hand me that magazine.
- What is it?

239
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,677
Two different ad numbers
mailed to the same address.

240
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:55,799
Ronnette's and one other.

241
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,602
Yeah, here it is.

242
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:05,720
"Student requires education in ways
of love. Generous, mature men only."

243
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,999
It's Laura.

244
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,802
You see some identifying mark?

245
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,005
- The drapes.
- Drapes?

246
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,924
Red drapes, Harry.
From my dream.

247
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:30,838
Why would an apartment dweller like
Jacques buy 50 gallons of heating oil?

248
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,240
- To heat a log cabin.
- Harry, you're all right!

249
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,604
Jacques' brother mentioned
a place by the state line.

250
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,082
Fellas, pack a lunch.
We're taking a walk in the woods.

251
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,006
Madeleine!

252
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:52,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

253
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:58,158
Hi, I'm Madeleine Ferguson.
My friends call me Maddy.

254
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,155
This is really nice of you guys,
I don't know anyone in town,

255
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,006
except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland.

256
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,525
And the mood at the house
isn't that great right now.

257
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:13,037
- Would you like something to drink?
- A cherry Coke.

258
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,566
You got it.

259
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:22,880
Madeleine, if I said that you can't
say a word of this to anyone,

260
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:25,322
would that be OK with you?

261
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,358
Sounds like some big secret.

262
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:31,242
It is. James and I knew Laura
better than anyone did.

263
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,400
She was in terrible trouble,
worse than we can imagine.

264
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,245
What?

265
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,639
I'd rather not say too much
about things we can't prove yet.

266
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,245
You said you can't prove it yet.

267
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,917
We're afraid the truth
might never come out

268
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:52,005
or whoever killed her
might never be caught.

269
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,522
We've sworn not to let that happen.

270
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,684
- You know who did it?
- We have some ideas.

271
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:02,085
- We wanted to ask for your help.
- What do you want me to do?

272
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,565
Laura talked about
a secret hiding place.

273
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:08,685
Somewhere in her house,
maybe in her room.

274
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,764
Nobody else knew about it.

275
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:15,284
She might have left something there
that could lead us to the killer.

276
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,360
- I'll help you.
- You will?

277
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:25,445
The day before she died,
I had a feeling Laura was in trouble.

278
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:30,122
I've always felt close to her.
That's why I came here.

279
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,405
You know...

280
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:36,560
I didn't really know Laura
that well, but I feel like I do.

281
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,998
Our folks always told us
how much alike we were.

282
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,080
Will you call me
if there's anything I can do?

283
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:46,006
I don't think
there'll be any problems.

284
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:48,437
Madeleine, this is really great.

285
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,319
Call me Maddy.

286
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,000
- Hi.
- Hi, Norma.

287
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:02,843
- We're like refugee beauty queens.
- You don't know how pretty you are.

288
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:06,238
I hope I don't chip a nail
slinging plates around.

289
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,722
- Hi, Norma.
- Hello, Hank.

290
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:12,277
- Surprised to see me?
- Yes.

291
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:19,400
- That Leo's girlfriend?
- Wife.

292
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,440
That Leo. So impulsive.

293
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,957
Not much meat on her, though.

294
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,958
I don't expect a kiss.

295
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:32,160
I figure I gotta earn my way
back into your heart.

296
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:33,920
But, Norma...

297
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,883
I intend to try.

298
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,200
So where do I start?

299
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,917
Washing dishes will be fine.

300
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,678
Can I finish my coffee first?

301
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,919
Boss?

302
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:19,365
He's been spending
more of his time in his room.

303
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,400
It's difficult to engage him
in conversation.

304
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,920
Terrible mood swings.

305
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:27,403
His school attendance
has become erratic at best.

306
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:31,356
And then the fighting at the Roadhouse
and at the funeral.

307
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,001
- Are you using drugs, Bobby?
- Nope.

308
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,840
- Alcohol's a drug.
- That's not what he meant.

309
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:39,925
- Alcohol doesn't count?
- Everybody drinks.

310
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,595
- Are you unhappy?
- Shouldn't I be?

311
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,158
That's not for me to say.

312
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,404
- Have you ever killed anybody?
- Have you?

313
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,597
- My father has.
- During wartime.

314
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:52,638
- That's different.
- From what?

315
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,284
Maybe I should spend a few minutes
with Bobby alone?

316
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:59,081
This is supposed to be
family counselling.

317
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:03,400
I'll need to spend time
with each member of the family alone.

318
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,598
- Bobby first.
- Fair enough.

319
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:07,604
Whatever you say.

320
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,401
Bobby, let's just cut the crap, huh?

321
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,560
So your parents don't understand
what you're going through.

322
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:31,285
That's a good one.

323
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:35,726
- Let's talk about Laura.
- OK, let's talk about Laura.

324
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:41,285
Bobby, what happened the first time
that you and Laura made love?

325
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,766
What the hell kind of question
is that?

326
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,679
Bobby, did you cry?

327
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,078
Did I what?

328
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,997
And then what did Laura do,
did she laugh at you?

329
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,160
Were you very sad when Laura died?

330
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:19,162
- Laura wanted to die.
- How do you know that?

331
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:28,240
Because she told me.

332
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,955
What else did she tell you?

333
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:37,640
Did she tell you there was
no goodness in the world?

334
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:44,162
She said people tried to be good,

335
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,006
but they were really
sick and rotten.

336
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,243
Her, most of all.

337
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:54,567
Every time she tried to make
the world a better place,

338
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,718
something terrible
came up inside her

339
00:25:56,927 --> 00:26:00,715
and pulled her back down into hell.

340
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:06,001
It took her deeper and deeper
into the blackest nightmare.

341
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,364
Every time, it got harder
to go back up to the light.

342
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,836
Did you sometimes have the feeling

343
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:15,596
Laura was harbouring
some awful secret?

344
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:17,081
Yeah.

345
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,842
- Bad enough that she wanted to die?
- Yes.

346
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:25,319
Bad enough to drive her to prey
upon people's weaknesses,

347
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:28,087
tempt them, break them down?

348
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:31,876
- Make them do degrading things?
- Yes.

349
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:37,565
Laura wanted to corrupt people because
that's how she felt about herself.

350
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,195
Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

351
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:44,715
Is that what Laura did to you?

352
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:48,278
She wanted so much.

353
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:52,561
She made me sell drugs
so she could have them.

354
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:24,922
This way. Through here.

355
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:28,517
- Watch your step there, city boy.
- Thanks, Harry.

356
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:41,559
What is it, Hawk?

357
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,685
- Not the cabin we're looking for.
- Maybe, maybe not.

358
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,680
Might wanna hang back a step, Doc.

359
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:06,003
Might want to anyway.

360
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,883
About time you got here.

361
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,597
They move so slowly
when they're not afraid.

362
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:37,401
Come on, then.
My log does not judge.

363
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,566
I've got tea.

364
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,327
I've got cookies. No cake.

365
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:58,038
That's very kind of you, ma'am,
but I don't believe...

366
00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:00,284
What kind of cookies?

367
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,165
Sugar.

368
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,086
The owls won't see us in here.

369
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:09,721
A cup of tea would be very nice.

370
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,518
Shut your eyes
and you'll burst into flames.

371
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,685
Thanks, Margaret.

372
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:19,797
We'll let it steep.

373
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:29,085
Wait for the tea.
The fish aren't running.

374
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:33,803
- You've been expecting us?
- You're two days late.

375
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,955
But that's your concern.

376
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:41,960
My log saw something.
Something significant.

377
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:48,199
- What did your log see?
- Tea first, then be ready.

378
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,360
Thank you.

379
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,644
- My husband was a logging man.
- Oh?

380
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:04,678
He met the devil. Fire is the devil,
hiding like a coward in the smoke.

381
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:08,601
It was the day after the wedding,
wasn't it, Margaret?

382
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,840
The wood holds many spirits, doesn't it?

383
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,236
You can ask it now.

384
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,722
What did you see that night?

385
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,203
The night Laura Palmer was killed?

386
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,517
I'll do the talking.

387
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,558
Dark.

388
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:44,200
Laughing. The owls were flying.

389
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,238
Many things were blocked.

390
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:50,765
Laughing. Two men. Two girls.

391
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,363
Flashlights pass by...

392
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,121
in the woods over the ridge.

393
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:58,318
The owls were near.

394
00:30:58,527 --> 00:31:01,917
The dark was pressing in on her.

395
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:06,886
Quiet then. Later, footsteps.

396
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,844
One man pass by.

397
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,676
Screams, far away.

398
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:17,366
Terrible. Terrible.

399
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:20,195
- One voice.
- Man or girl?

400
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,443
Girl.

401
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:26,403
Further up. Over the ridge.

402
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,963
The owls were silent.

403
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:42,084
The two girls were
Laura and Ronnette.

404
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:46,559
The two men?
Jacques? Maybe Leo?

405
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,200
Maybe.

406
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,317
Who's the third man?

407
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,637
Do you hear it?

408
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,478
This way.

409
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,442
"And there's always music
in the air."

410
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,485
Waldo.

411
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:16,522
There's film in here.

412
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,480
Blood.

413
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:45,960
One-Eyed Jacks.

414
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:09,036
- Good evening. Mr and Mrs Showel?
- OK, go right ahead.

415
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,957
- Good evening.
- Catherine Martell and spouse.

416
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:20,879
Go easy on the sauce tonight,
OK, Cathy?

417
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:29,797
A couple of belts and even you
might start to look good to me.

418
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,364
The modern age changed everything,
Mr Thorson.

419
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:50,276
But it's my guess that
there's still vestigial interest

420
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,597
in the folklore of Iceland.

421
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:55,361
Vestigial. Absolutely.

422
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,876
Heba, did you know
that was a saying?

423
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,401
No, Jerry.

424
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,605
Heba-heba.
You never heard that before?

425
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:04,599
No, Jerry.

426
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,519
Do you realise the incredible
potential that could result

427
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:24,041
from our taking a mutual dip
in each other's respective gene pools?

428
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:27,997
Heba, I want to cook for you.

429
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:31,926
Very, very good. That's funny.

430
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:37,559
So he says, "What do you get when
you cross a Norwegian with a Swede?"

431
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:41,402
A socialist who wants to be king!

432
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,761
Well, I can remember
it was somewhere in the '50s

433
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:48,441
I came through your country.
Beautiful.

434
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,241
Not many trees, you know, but...

435
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:01,960
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

436
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:05,963
Meet me in my office.
Give me two minutes to break away.

437
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:09,523
- Hell hath no fury.
- What?

438
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,805
Two minutes.

439
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:15,485
Thor, I've been meaning to ask you,

440
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:18,605
are you familiar
with the word Iuhamsta?

441
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:41,520
Catherine, we agreed.

442
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:46,005
No scenes in front of the guests.
Keep the melodrama to a minimum.

443
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:49,995
Next thing I know, you're polishing
my shoes with Dom Perignon.

444
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,159
Fill me in. What's eating you?

445
00:36:56,167 --> 00:37:00,877
Why did you have this $1,000 chip
from you know where in your pants?

446
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:05,598
I thought you preferred women
with certain experience.

447
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,237
Jerry gave me that.

448
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:12,401
It's good luck. I thought I'd lost it.

449
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,598
I'm so relieved you found it.

450
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,043
Are you quite finished?

451
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,319
Yes.

452
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:27,564
In that case....

453
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:38,246
Let's burn the mill.
Let's do it tonight.

454
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:42,366
No, my love, we'll give Josie
one last chance to sell.

455
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:45,001
Tomorrow. Failing that...

456
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:51,396
I have retained the services
of a qualified professional.

457
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:53,796
Breath mint?

458
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:12,243
Now let me get this straight.

459
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:18,999
Your entire country
is above the timberline?

460
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:22,000
Folks, can I have
your attention, please?

461
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:24,238
Can I have your attention?

462
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:29,202
Thank you for turning out
to welcome our neighbours

463
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,001
from the magical isle of Iceland.

464
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:39,718
We are all Icelanders!

465
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:46,036
Ghostwood Estates is
an important part of our future,

466
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:51,077
and there's no one we'd rather have
as partners in our future than...

467
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:09,841
Dance with him.

468
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:12,237
It is serious. Dance with him.

469
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:22,921
All right!

470
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,641
Hey, Jerry. What's going on?

471
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:33,635
Get Jacoby, get a net,
but get him out of my life.

472
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,041
Jerry.

473
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:45,799
Donna? It's Maddy.

474
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:50,916
I remembered, when we were younger,
Laura hid cigarettes in her bedpost.

475
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,358
The top of one of the posts
screws off.

476
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:58,556
- I found a tape in her hiding place.
- Leland?

477
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:01,321
I'll meet you and James tomorrow.

478
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:04,837
OK! And bring a tape recorder.

479
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:42,405
Did anyone see you come in here?

480
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,000
No.

481
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:49,357
You do realise the risk
if anyone sees us.

482
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:54,520
This was hidden in her desk,
where you said it would be.

483
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,605
- Then we can proceed.
- When?

484
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,078
Tomorrow night.

485
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:58,364
I told you to mind the store,
not open a franchise.

486
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,961
- Hank, I...
- Do as you're told, Leo.

487
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:06,195
Next time you'll watch me take
your chippy apart before I kill you.

488
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,597
- Get me a beer.
- What happened?

489
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:15,763
Just get me a damn beer!

490
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:19,720
Get up and...

491
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,838
- What are you doing?
- You're not gonna hurt me again.

492
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:27,607
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me, Leo!

493
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,844
You stupid little slut!

494
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:32,719
You haven't got the guts.

495
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,876
Reach over and turn on the light.

496
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,602
Don't make me leave.

497
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,684
Please, don't make me leave.
