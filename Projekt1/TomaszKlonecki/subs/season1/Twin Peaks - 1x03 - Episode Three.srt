1
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:14,159
They're burying this girl tomorrow, and
we've wasted half the day getting here.

2
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,443
Dr Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.

3
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,400
Laura was a patient of mine.

4
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:23,606
Youpunks owe me ten grand.
Leo needs a new pair of shoes.

5
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:27,646
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter
into a dialogue with me, your father.

6
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:31,641
Here's the key. The ledger's inside.

7
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:33,559
Two books...

8
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:36,121
When youleast expect it...

9
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:40,084
We have to dance, Sarah.
We have to dance... For Laura.

10
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:43,045
Leland! Leland! Give it to me!

11
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:52,036
Harry? It's Cooper.

12
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:54,767
Meet me for breakfast, 7:00 am,
the hotel lobby.

13
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:57,361
I know who killed Laura Palmer.

14
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:14,885
Diane, 7:15 am. I'll be heading for
the Sheriff's after breakfast.

15
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,483
From there we'll be going on
to Laura Palmer's funeral.

16
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,279
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.

17
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,999
Just Agent, Audrey. Special Agent.

18
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,805
Special Agent.

19
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:44,199
Would youcare to join me
for breakfast?

20
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,807
- I'm in a hurry.
- For what?

21
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:52,678
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.

22
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,116
- Do youreally think so?
- Yes, I do. Please, have a seat.

23
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:02,398
And would youwrite your name down
for me? Here.

24
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:04,800
OK.

25
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,725
Audrey, there's something
you'd like to tell me.

26
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:19,798
There is?

27
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,239
Youslipped this note underneath
my door the night before last.

28
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,716
I did?

29
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:32,441
I wanted to help you. For Laura.

30
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,127
Yousaid youand Laura
weren't exactly friends.

31
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:39,200
We weren't friends, but I
understood her better than the rest.

32
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:43,286
- What is "One-Eyed Jacks?"
- It's a place up north.

33
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,120
- Men go there.
- What about women?

34
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,516
Women...youknow, work there.

35
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,839
Did Laura work there?

36
00:04:55,687 --> 00:05:00,203
I don't know. Laura worked
at my father's department store.

37
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:03,205
- Horne's?
- He named it after himself.

38
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,079
Where at Horne's department store?

39
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,399
At the perfume counter.

40
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,246
- So did Ronnette Pulaski.
- Really?

41
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:18,598
The rightward slant in your handwriting
indicates a romantic nature.

42
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,406
A heart that yearns. Be careful.

43
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,044
I do?

44
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:34,645
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now. Police business.

45
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,241
Thank youfor talking to me.

46
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,324
Trudy, two more coffees, please.

47
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:51,603
Harry, Lucy...

48
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,356
It is an absolutely beautiful morning.

49
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:58,997
Griddlecakes, melted butter, maple
syrup, lightly heated, slice of ham.

50
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:03,245
Nothing beats the taste sensation
when maple syrup collides with ham.

51
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:05,801
Griddlecakes, slice of ham.

52
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,804
Who killed Laura Palmer?

53
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:15,246
Let me tell youabout the dream
I had last night.

54
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,363
- Tibet?
- No.

55
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:20,081
Youwere there. Lucy, so were you.

56
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,796
Harry, my dream is a code
waiting to be broken.

57
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:26,395
Break the code, solve the crime.

58
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:30,799
"Break the code, solve the crime."

59
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:34,998
In my dream, Sarah Palmer
has a vision of her daughter's killer.

60
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,998
Deputy Hawk sketched his picture.

61
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:40,244
I got a phone call from
a one-armed man named Mike.

62
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,006
- The killer's name was Bob.
- Mike and Bobby?

63
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,317
No, it's a different Mike
and a different Bob.

64
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,915
They lived above
a convenience store.

65
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:53,605
They had a tattoo,
"Fire, walk with me".

66
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:56,725
Mike couldn't stand the killing
any more, so he cut off his arm.

67
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:59,401
Bob vowed to kill again,
so Mike shot him.

68
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:03,202
Do youknow
where dreams come from?

69
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,204
- Not specifically.
- No.

70
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:10,242
Acetylcholine neurons fire
high-voltage impulses into the forebrain.

71
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:14,366
These impulses become pictures,
the pictures become dreams, but...

72
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,325
no one knows why we choose
these particular pictures.

73
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:20,200
So what was the end of this dream?

74
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:24,360
Suddenly, it was 25 years later.
I was old, sitting in a red room.

75
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,722
There was a midget in a red suit
and a beautiful woman.

76
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,765
The midget told me that my favourite
gum was coming back into style,

77
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:33,522
and didn't his cousin look exactly
like Laura Palmer, which she did.

78
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,996
- What cousin?
- The beautiful woman.

79
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,522
She's filled with secrets.

80
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:40,717
Sometimes her arms bend back.

81
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,077
Where she's from,
the birds sing a pretty song

82
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:46,523
and there's always music in the air.
The midget did a dance.

83
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:50,606
Laura kissed me and she whispered
the name of the killer in my ear.

84
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:54,917
- Who was it?
- I don't remember.

85
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:58,325
- Damn!
- Damn!

86
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:01,365
Harry, our job is simple:
break the code, solve the crime.

87
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,556
Yeah?

88
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,480
Sheriff, I'm at the morgue
and there's a big fight going on.

89
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:09,563
Youhang on, I'll be right there.

90
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,844
That was Andy.
There's a fight over at the morgue.

91
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:14,122
Albert.

92
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,524
You're the most cold-blooded man
I've ever seen.

93
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:21,401
I've never known such little regard for
human frailty. Have youno compassion?

94
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,685
I've got compassion running out of
my nose. I'm the Sultan of Sentiment.

95
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,963
Doctor Hayward,
I have travelled thousands of miles

96
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,647
and apparently several centuries
to this forgotten sinkhole

97
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,405
to perform a series of tests.

98
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,280
I do not ask youto understand
these tests. I'm not cruel.

99
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,757
I just ask youto get out,
so I can finish my work!

100
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:41,282
We are here to conduct
Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery.

101
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:44,837
If youthink we're gonna leave
without her, youare crazy!

102
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,963
All right, all right, all right!

103
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,165
Mr Rosenfield, please.

104
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:58,164
Leland Palmer couldn't be
with us today,

105
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,677
but I know I speak for everyone,
the Palmer family included,

106
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:07,604
when I say that we appreciate and
understand the value of your work.

107
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:11,800
But, as their representative,
I must insist

108
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,721
that we consider the feelings
of the Palmer family as well.

109
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,522
Mr Horne, I realise that your position
in this fair community

110
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,684
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity

111
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,315
and a rather irritating method
of expressing yourself.

112
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,723
Stupidity, however,
is not a necessarily inherent trait.

113
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:34,363
Therefore, please listen closely.
Youcan have a funeral any old time.

114
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,324
Youdig a hole, youplant a coffin.

115
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:39,439
l, however, cannot perform
these tests next year,

116
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:43,839
next month, next week or tomorrow.
I must perform them now.

117
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:47,082
I've got a lot of cutting
and pasting to do, so please,

118
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:50,444
why don't youreturn to your
porch rockers and resume whittling?

119
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:54,520
That does it. I'm taking charge of
the body and youdon't touch Laura...

120
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,319
What the hell
do youthink you're doing?!

121
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,722
- Gentlemen.
- What's going on?

122
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,599
Thank God!

123
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,839
This old fool is obstructing
a criminal investigation. Cuff him!

124
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:07,720
He won't release Laura's body
for the funeral. He's not human.

125
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,122
- What's the hold-up?
- Please, Cooper.

126
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:13,478
I do not suffer fools gladly,
and fools with badges, never.

127
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:17,003
I want no interference
from this hulking boob. Is that clear?

128
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,317
I've had just about enough
of your insults.

129
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,199
Oh, yeah?

130
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,677
Well, I've had about enough of
morons and half-wits,

131
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,520
dolts, dunces,
dullards and dumbbells.

132
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,247
And youchowderhead yokel,
youblithering hayseed,

133
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,562
you've had enough of me?

134
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,518
Yes, I have.

135
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,957
That's nice. How appropriate.

136
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,324
Wait in the car, Harry.

137
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:54,756
The old rustic sucker punch, huh?
A hail of bullets would be nice.

138
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,999
That's enough.
The sheriff didn't mean anything.

139
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,762
- He hit me.
- Well, I'm sure he meant to do that.

140
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:04,924
Albert, release this girl's body
to her family immediately.

141
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,602
I want your test results by noon.
Those are orders.

142
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,360
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

143
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,683
Invitation to love

144
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:50,045
Starring Martin Hadley as Chet...

145
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:55,240
Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade...

146
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:00,316
Evan St Vincent as Jared Lancaster...

147
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:05,076
and Jason Denbo as Montana.

148
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:12,963
My darling daughter Jade...and Emerald.

149
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:18,201
Because of my financial difficulties,
I have decided to end it all tonight.

150
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:22,645
I hope youcan find the strength to
go on without me. Your loving father...

151
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,843
Uncle Leland?

152
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,037
Uncle Leland?

153
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,605
Madeleine?

154
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,724
Jadr, what a surprisr.

155
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:50,406
Maddy? Is it you?

156
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,364
Uncle Leland...

157
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:58,764
I am so sorry.

158
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:18,763
I'm sure Hank appreciates
your unwavering devotion.

159
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,843
Your husband has been
a model prisoner,

160
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:24,079
an inspiration to guard
and inmate alike.

161
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,965
He greets the day with a smile

162
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,647
and confounds adversity
with a kind word.

163
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,916
Hank's parole hearing
is scheduled for tomorrow.

164
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,555
Barring unforeseen circumstance,

165
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,485
with your full support
before the board,

166
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,480
he could be released
shortly thereafter.

167
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,398
Any questions?

168
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:45,563
No.

169
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:50,881
Will youhelp find the job that Hank
needs to effect successful parole?

170
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,277
- Yes.
- How exactly?

171
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,518
I own the RR Mr Mooney.

172
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,445
You're quite a girl, Norma.

173
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:06,163
I'll bet youget all kinds of Romeos
in here begging for favours.

174
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:07,959
How do youkeep them
from your door?

175
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,403
I usually tell them I have
a homicidally jealous husband

176
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,842
who's doing 3-5 for manslaughter.

177
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,322
But he expects to be a productive
member of society real soon.

178
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,759
That should conclude our session
for today, Mrs Jennings.

179
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,642
Look at that!

180
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,763
Ducks on the lake!

181
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:33,283
So fill me in on Leo Johnson.

182
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,961
Leo's one of those guys
youkeep your eye on.

183
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:40,200
So far, we haven't caught him
with his paws in the cookie jar.

184
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:43,158
Morning, Leo.

185
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,166
Who the hell is he?

186
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:49,404
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI.

187
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,041
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

188
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,402
So ask.

189
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:57,437
"Leo". Is that short for "Leonard"?

190
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:59,837
That's a question?

191
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,559
- Did youknow Laura Palmer?
- No.

192
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,838
- How well did youknow her?
- I said I didn't.

193
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,559
You're lying.

194
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,119
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.

195
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:18,363
- Do youhave a criminal record?
- Nothing. Youcan look it up.

196
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,199
Illegal U-turn, April 1986.

197
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,999
Drunk and disorderly,
November 1987.

198
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:26,206
September '88, aggravated assault,
charges dropped.

199
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,359
I paid my debt to society.

200
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:33,566
Where were youthe night of Laura
Palmer's murder? Around midnight?

201
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:37,521
On the road. I called my wife Shelly
from Butte, Montana.

202
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:40,846
- She'll confirm this?
- If youask her.

203
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,285
Robert?

204
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,595
This may be a good time
for a brief discussion.

205
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:07,198
Youwant to talk about cigarettes?
Today?

206
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,645
No, but put it out. It's a filthy habit,
especially for a varsity athlete.

207
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:30,204
I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many.

208
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:34,155
Any time a man dies in war,
he dies too soon.

209
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,322
Laura died too soon as well.

210
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,357
Yeah, she did.

211
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:44,285
But we have a responsibility
to the dead, Robert.

212
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,405
Responsibility is the linchpin
of our society.

213
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,478
Each man responsible
for his own actions,

214
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,559
each action contributing
to the greater good.

215
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:57,560
What's the good of putting someone
in the ground?

216
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,963
That's man's way of achieving closure.

217
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,237
In ceremony begins understanding

218
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,916
and the will to carry on
without those we must leave behind.

219
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:12,046
In your life, youmust learn, you
will learn, to carry on without them.

220
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,680
Great.

221
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,846
I realise youexperience
an ongoing disinclination

222
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,004
to enter fully into
meaningful ex change.

223
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,482
This leads to stalemate

224
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,765
and a desire on my part to force
certain wisdom upon you.

225
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,718
This isn't necessarily a bad thing,

226
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:34,964
sometimes it's
the best course available.

227
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,037
Son, don't be afraid.

228
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,767
We'll all be there together.

229
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,079
- Afraid of what?
- Well, the funeral.

230
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:51,677
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.

231
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,246
Afraid?

232
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:58,924
I can hardly wait.

233
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,884
Afraid?!

234
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,005
I'm gonna turn it upside down!

235
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,958
Everybody ready?

236
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,886
Deputy Hawk.

237
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:20,158
Agent Cooper, there's no sign
of the man with one arm.

238
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,642
Keep trying.
He's out there somewhere.

239
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:25,798
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

240
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,162
- He's a tracker?
- The best.

241
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,878
OK, Albert.
What have yougot?

242
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,083
Enough forensic spadework
to save your butt

243
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,556
and get mine out of
this godforsaken burg.

244
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,521
What have yougot?

245
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:46,317
OK, first of all, contents of envelope
found in Palmer diary: cocaine.

246
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,284
Toxicology results also positive.

247
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,280
Newsflash: the little lady had a habit.

248
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,245
We've got fibres of twine embedded
in her wrists and upper arms.

249
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,921
Two different kinds of twine.

250
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,796
Fibres of twine found in railroad car
matched the sample from her wrist.

251
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,356
The same twine was used
to bind the Pulaski girl.

252
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:07,719
Conclusion: she was tied up twice, at
different locations, the night she died.

253
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,317
Once here, once here. Like this.

254
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:14,481
"Sometimes my arms bend back."

255
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,963
We found traces of pumice in
standing water outside the railroad car.

256
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,879
Soap, industrial strength.

257
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:25,080
I found identical particles on Laura's
neck. It's not her home-use brand.

258
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,717
My conclusion:
the killer washed his hands

259
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,078
and then leaned in for a kiss.
Like this.

260
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,759
Good Lord...

261
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,845
Distinctive wounds found
on Laura's neck and shoulder

262
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:43,602
appear to be claw marks,
bites of some kind.

263
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:45,681
An animal?

264
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,277
Look, it's trying to think.

265
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,487
Finally, a small plastic fragment
from her stomach,

266
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:59,925
partially dissolved by digestive acids.
I'm taking it back for reconstruction,

267
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:03,164
as the local facilities give
new meaning to the word "primitive".

268
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,563
I note with some interest
what appears to be the letter "J".

269
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,561
Good work, Albert.

270
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:12,155
A couple more days, who knows
what I might have found?

271
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,517
Sheriff? It's time.

272
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:20,162
Ex cuse us. We have got
a funeral to get to.

273
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,955
Cooper, may I have
a word with youalone?

274
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:35,200
There's also a report concerning
the physical assault on me this morning.

275
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:38,876
I think you'll find it's quite accurate.
Requires your signature.

276
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:43,036
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.

277
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,401
What?

278
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:50,726
Albert, I hope youcan hear me. I've
only been in Twin Peaks a short time.

279
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:54,396
But in that time I have seen decency,
honour and dignity.

280
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,523
Murder is not a faceless event here.

281
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:59,918
It is not a statistic
to be tallied up at the end of the day.

282
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:03,636
Laura Palmer's death has affected
every man, woman and child

283
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,798
because life has meaning here,
every life.

284
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,879
That's a way of living I thought
had vanished, but it hasn't.

285
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,197
It's right here in Twin Peaks.

286
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:16,277
Sounds like you've been snacking
on some of the local mushrooms.

287
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,517
With your behaviour
towards these good people,

288
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,155
you're lucky
I do not file a report

289
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:25,280
that could bury youso deep in
Washington you'd never see the sun.

290
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,362
Diane, it's 12:27 pm.

291
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:43,878
Look into my pension plan options
on outside real estate investment.

292
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,845
I may purchase a piece of property
at what I assume

293
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,760
will be a very reasonable price.

294
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,163
Love me?

295
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:22,084
Youbet.

296
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:25,759
This a new one?

297
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:29,482
Yes.

298
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:31,877
Isn't it beautiful?

299
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,278
How do I look?

300
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:44,721
- Well, youlook fine, Nadine.
- Oh, Ed!

301
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,645
Last night was wonderful.

302
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:54,562
Oh, my darling Ed,
youcame back to me.

303
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,041
Now I feel like we're
really together again.

304
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,200
In high school,

305
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:18,840
I used to watch Norma and you
at those football games.

306
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:22,158
She was so pretty.

307
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,279
Youmade such a handsome couple.

308
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,205
But I knew...

309
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,000
even though...

310
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,685
I was just...

311
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:37,202
a little nobody...

312
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:43,203
just a little brown mouse...

313
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,440
I always knew inside...

314
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,961
once yougot to know me...

315
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,958
we'd be together forever.

316
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:05,562
That's not your bike, is it, Ed?

317
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,718
It's James.

318
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,558
James who?

319
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:28,561
- We don't want to be late. Ready?
- I'm not going.

320
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:31,205
It's Laura, James.

321
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:35,724
- I can't. I just can't.
- James!

322
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,123
I don't care what the doctor says.

323
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,563
If youkeep indulging him,
he is never going to change.

324
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:49,440
I don't think we should discuss this
while Johnny is here.

325
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:53,202
- Johnny doesn't know what day it is.
- We have to be patient, Ben.

326
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:57,844
Yoube patient. I have waited 20 years
for some sign of intelligent life.

327
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,357
I'm clear about this, Sylvia.
I have my limits.

328
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,045
Don't I know it?

329
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,880
Fine, let's all spray venom
in my general direction.

330
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:15,205
- Youtake it with no problem.
- Taking it is a speciality of the house.

331
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,916
Sylvia, I'm gonna make it
extremely simple for you.

332
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,284
We can't take Johnny to the funeral
in that ridiculous getup.

333
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:26,565
Then let the great Doctor Jacoby
see what he can do.

334
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,718
Youdo it then.

335
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:30,718
Am I going to have to call
Doctor Jacoby

336
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:34,436
every damn time I have
a problem with Johnny?

337
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:51,562
Thank God. All right, let's everyone
just get into the car.

338
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,599
I am the Resurrection and the Life.

339
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,440
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

340
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:16,001
yet shall he live.

341
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,079
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me

342
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,238
shall never die.

343
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,323
For none of us liveth to himself

344
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:26,001
and no man dieth to himself.

345
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,964
For, if we live, we live unto the Lord

346
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:33,483
and, if we die, we die unto the Lord.

347
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:39,160
Whether we live, therefore, or we die,
we are the Lord's.

348
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:42,802
Blessed be the dead
who die in the Lord.

349
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:48,519
Even so saith the Spirit,
for they rest from their labours.

350
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:50,478
The Lord be with thee.

351
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,359
Let us pray.

352
00:26:55,207 --> 00:27:00,565
O, God, entrust this child Laura
to Thy never-failing care and love

353
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,400
and bring us all
to Thy heavenly kingdom

354
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,599
through the same, Thy son,
Jesus Christ, our Lord,

355
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:10,726
who liveth and reigneth with Thee,
and the Holy Spirit,

356
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:14,926
one God, now and forever. Amen.

357
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,277
I baptised Laura Palmer.

358
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:23,520
I instructed her in Sunday school.

359
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:27,726
And l, like the rest of you, came to
love her with that special love

360
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:32,756
that we reserve for the headstrong
and the bold.

361
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,039
Laura was bright.

362
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,957
She was beautiful, she was charming.

363
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:46,921
But most of all Laura was,
I think, impatient.

364
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:49,999
She was impatient for her life
to begin,

365
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:54,957
for the world to finally catch up
to her dreams and ambitions.

366
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,521
Laura used to say that I talk too much.

367
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:00,599
I'll not make that mistake today.

368
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:04,601
Just let it be said that I loved her

369
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,884
and I will miss her
the rest of my days.

370
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,686
Amen!

371
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:12,644
Amen!

372
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,395
Thank you, Johnny.

373
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:20,365
Amen!

374
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:29,043
What are youlooking at?

375
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,558
What are youwaiting for?

376
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,157
Youmake me sick.

377
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:39,165
Youdamn hypocrites make me sick!

378
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:43,838
Everybody knew she was in trouble,

379
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:46,282
but we didn't do anything.

380
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,757
All yougood people...

381
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,357
Youwanna know who killed Laura?

382
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,318
Youdid!

383
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,723
We all did.

384
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,156
And pretty words aren't gonna bring
her back, man, so save your prayers.

385
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:07,120
She would've laughed at them
anyway.

386
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:16,919
Youare dead, man! You're dead!

387
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,647
That's enough, Bobby. That's enough!

388
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:30,078
Youare dead!

389
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,440
Get off me!

390
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:36,198
Youare dead, man. Dead!

391
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,199
Youare dead, man. God... Dead!

392
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,524
Get off me!

393
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,645
Ah, my baby. Laura!

394
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,321
Laura! Laura!

395
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:58,125
Lee, hang on.

396
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,565
The whole thing has gone haywire.

397
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:11,125
Don't ruin this, too!

398
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,685
My baby!

399
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,364
Laura!

400
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:27,557
Laura!

401
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:49,560
Here's the father
and this is his daughter in the coffin.

402
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:03,357
I'm telling you, Harry,
he's just not gonna figure this out.

403
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:07,156
Ed, that's a bet I'll take. For the check.

404
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,198
He's right on time.

405
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,636
Harry, careful who youtrust.
He's just not one of us.

406
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,718
Cooper, take a seat.

407
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,837
Harry, I got your note.
Hawk. Big Ed.

408
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:22,080
How would youlike
some fresh huckleberry pie?

409
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:26,966
I would love a slice of pie.
Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated.

410
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,079
- Vanilla ice cream, coffee.
- Coming right up.

411
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:36,245
Big Ed, how long have youbeen
in love with Norma?

412
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,199
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.

413
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:50,362
What did youcall me in for
besides the highlights of the menu?

414
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:52,006
You'd better tell him.

415
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,961
Somebody's running drugs into
Twin Peaks from across the border.

416
00:31:56,127 --> 00:32:00,439
We've tried for six months to set up a bust,
top to bottom. Nobody walks.

417
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,444
- Who's targeted?
- Jacques Renault.

418
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:05,724
Bartender at the Roadhouse.
We figure him for the middle man.

419
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:07,758
Ed's been doing some undercover.

420
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:10,765
The night yougot into town,
he was staking Renault out.

421
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,798
We think Renault slipped him
a mickey.

422
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,122
Felt like being hit with a log splitter.

423
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:18,364
- I didn't know youwere a deputy.
- He's not.

424
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:22,206
It's a little outside your jurisdiction.

425
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,755
Somebody's selling drugs
to high school kids.

426
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,878
That's everybody's jurisdiction.

427
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:30,966
I call Ed in when I need him.
He's not the only one I called.

428
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,640
- Thanks, Norma.
- Enjoy.

429
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:46,357
This must be where pies go
when they die.

430
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:53,517
OK, Harry, would youplease tell me
why youreally called me in here?

431
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:57,037
Go along with me on this,
even if it sounds a little weird.

432
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,880
- I'm with you.
- Twin Peaks is different.

433
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,083
A long way from the world.
You've noticed that.

434
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:06,001
- Yes, I have.
- That's exactly the way we like it.

435
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:11,360
But there's a back end to that
that's kind of different, too.

436
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:13,762
Maybe that's the price we pay
for the good things.

437
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:17,675
- What would that be?
- There's a sort of evil out there.

438
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:23,366
Something very, very strange
in these old woods.

439
00:33:23,527 --> 00:33:27,406
Call it what youwant.
A darkness. A presence.

440
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,319
It takes many forms,

441
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:33,520
but it's been out there for as long
as anyone can remember.

442
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:37,606
- We've always been here to fight it.
- We?

443
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:42,755
Men before us. Men before them.

444
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:46,806
- More after we're gone.
- A secret society.

445
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,844
Why don't we take Agent Cooper
for a little ride?

446
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:55,196
- Where to?
- The Bookhouse.

447
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,441
This is where we get together.

448
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:12,840
- Going on 20 years now.
- "We" meaning...?

449
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,202
The Bookhouse Boys.

450
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:18,239
- Coffee's free.
- Like the sound of that.

451
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:24,798
Cooper, youknow James.

452
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:27,157
- Agent Cooper.
- James.

453
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:30,120
- This is Joey Paulson.
- Joey.

454
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:33,484
- Who's this?
- Bernard Renault, Jacques' brother.

455
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:36,207
Janitor at the Roadhouse.

456
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:41,162
Bernard came across the border this
morning with an ounce of cocaine.

457
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,006
Thought we'd ask him
a few questions.

458
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:52,000
- Did yousell drugs to Laura Palmer?
- I don't sell drugs.

459
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:54,277
How much does Jacques pay you
to be the mule?

460
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,678
Jacques don't pay me nothing.
I'm no mule.

461
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:01,760
- So that ounce was for personal use?
- That's right.

462
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,487
I guess youdon't get much sleep
at night, Bernie.

463
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,445
Your brother didn't come to work
the last few days. Where's he been?

464
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,917
I don't know.
He got personal business.

465
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:14,244
- Who else is he dealing with?
- Why don't youask him?

466
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,642
He'll be back tonight. Any minute.

467
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:20,482
- To work at the Roadhouse?
- He's the bartender, isn't he?

468
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:23,764
Bernard, we've got youtied up
in a chair.

469
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:27,806
You're mix ed up with your brother
in a wide variety of felonies.

470
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:32,239
Why in the world would youtell us
where and when to find him?

471
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,560
- Yeah?
- Leo, it's Jacques.

472
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:11,002
- What's up?
- The light. The bust light's on.

473
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,004
- Bernard's in trouble.
- Yousure?

474
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:17,086
I saw it, man. Yougotta get me
out of here, Leo. Border run.

475
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:20,597
- Where are you?
- Phone booth by the Cash & Carry.

476
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:24,760
- And I don't like waiting, man.
- Shut up. I'm on my way.

477
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,206
Hi.

478
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:34,684
- Where are yougoing?
- Youdon't need to know.

479
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:13,242
Josie? Josie, what's wrong?

480
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:15,801
Nothing.

481
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:19,446
Nothing?

482
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:28,602
God, you're beautiful.

483
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:41,278
Josie, there is something wrong.

484
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:44,041
What is it? I want youto tell me.

485
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,801
Something horrible is going
to happen.

486
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:54,962
- They want to hurt me. I know it.
- Who? Who wants to hurt you?

487
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:59,284
Catherine.
Catherine and Benjamin Horne.

488
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:04,484
What makes youthink so?

489
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:07,639
I heard Catherine on the phone

490
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,719
saying I'd never suspect.

491
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,798
Just like with Andrew's death.

492
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:16,920
- Andrew's death was an accident.
- Was it?

493
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,766
Catherine keeps
the mill account books in her safe.

494
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,919
Two books, different numbers.

495
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:28,246
Andrew built this years ago.

496
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,483
I don't think Catherine knows
that I know it's here.

497
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:39,646
Why do youthink they have
two sets of books?

498
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:44,085
The usual reasons would be something
to do with stealing. Maybe worse.

499
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,007
There were two. I sawthem.

500
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:56,119
- Youbelieve me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

501
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:02,357
- There's nothing unusual in this one.
- There were two.

502
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,882
I swear, there were two.

503
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:22,796
Have...have youseen my tackle box?

504
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,798
The next time youand the merry
widow want to take a peak in my safe,

505
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:29,883
don't go to so much trouble.

506
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:33,522
Be a man about it, Pete.
Ask me to my face.

507
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:41,839
Maybe I'll check the truck.

508
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,406
Dr Jacoby?

509
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,483
I didn't see youat the funeral today.

510
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,517
I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper.

511
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,122
I pretend that I'm not.

512
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:30,566
But I am.

513
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:37,606
Oh, I sit and listen to their problems.
Day after day.

514
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:42,926
These people think of me
as their friend.

515
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,199
Truth is, I really don't care.

516
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,596
I thought nothing,

517
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,316
no one could ever reach me again.

518
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,045
Laura changed all that.

519
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,639
I couldn't come today.

520
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,717
I just couldn't.

521
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,596
I hope she understands.

522
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,556
I hope she forgives me.

523
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:29,319
Youthink it's possible?

524
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:33,115
Youthink somebody killed Andrew?

525
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,725
I don't know.

526
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:44,805
I believe what they want is
to take the mill away from me.

527
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,675
For Benjamin to have the land.

528
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,044
If it was true with Andrew...

529
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:59,481
youthink they'll kill me too?
Think they would?

530
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:04,480
Josie...

531
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:09,197
Nothing is gonna happen to you.
Not now, not ever.

532
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,358
Not while I'm around.

533
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,399
Do youbelieve in the soul?

534
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:01,526
Several.

535
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:05,324
- More than one?
- Blackfoot legend.

536
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:09,804
Waking souls that give life
to the mind and the body.

537
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,117
A dream soul that wanders.

538
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:14,522
Dream souls...

539
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:18,799
- Where do they wander?
- Faraway places.

540
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,878
The Land of the Dead.

541
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:24,277
Is that where Laura is?

542
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:28,486
Laura is in the ground, Agent Cooper.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

543
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,478
To Laura.

544
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:47,679
Godspeed.

545
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,561
- Will youdance with me?
- Sorry.

546
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:59,001
Please?

547
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:02,527
Dance with me? Please?

548
00:44:03,687 --> 00:44:06,155
- Dance with me.
- Leave us alone.

549
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:09,359
Dance with me, please.
Please.

550
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,324
Please.

551
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,921
Somebody dance with me.

552
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:23,521
- Mr Palmer?
- Leland.

553
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:35,758
Let's take youhome.

554
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:37,724
Home...

555
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:42,800
Home. Home.
